has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they will be next to end up on the streets. But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it is like to be homeless? That is Goddard Bolts lesson.Mel Brooks who directs who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival Jeffery Tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. The bets on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cannot step off the sidewalk. He is given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it is written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly Lesley Ann Warren an exdancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals Sailor Howard Morris and Fumes Teddy Wilson who are already used to the streets. They are survivors. Bolt is not. He is not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it is fight or flight, kill or be killed.While the love connection between Molly and Bolt was not necessary to plot, I found Life Stinks to be one of Mel Brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what it is like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do not know what to do with their money.

The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker. Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like Little Miss Sunshine. There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it is this understated yet well reviewed role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award as of 2008. It is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it is scary too.This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend.

movies I can be pretty picky, and I will complain about anything and everything that is done wrong. While every movie has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count.If you read the last review it was hard, since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie, you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines into that same review, you discovered the posters reason for disdain heshe does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crack...apparently.So, despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director. Let us go over a quick checklist first 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I will not give a shred of it away, but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials. This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such. The story really will amaze you, even more so because it is true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events.2. Wonderful Acting? Oh Yes. Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy typecast, and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago. He once again achieves high form in his role in The Night Listener, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of...well, I will let you see for yourself.3. Excellent direction? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster to which I referred, I actually know something about direction. I have been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years. Of course I really do not think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction, but I thought I should simply establish once again that I am basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL.Patrick Stettners direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those sosoughtafter feelings of tension and release rather than the messy, fastpaced camerawork and quick cuts we are so often subjected to today. Some people can truly show you a story through their camera, while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera. I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized, which is as an eyeball through which we all see.4. Lighting, cinematography, and editing? Great all around. I have already wrote so much, and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so I will just wrap it up.In short, go see this movie. Do not listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 14 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show!

Firstly, the hatred towards this movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. It is a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I have rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen twice, or maybe three times, actually. But that might be it, the appeal of it. It is a Movie, yes, capital M there, it is an Epic, it is a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavyhanded at times.But the reason Titanic works is that it is such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie is not exactly dumb, but it is not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I did not cry when Bambis mom died, I do not react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And I am sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you will enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad? Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? No, not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It cannot be bad. Not possible. 1010.p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 911 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply was not anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i am pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.","index":34,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["What is inexplicable?

I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings. While 29.0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7 gave it a 1 rating. These 10.7 of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I have tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men, mostly, who defame him left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in Titanic. To answer one other user I am NOT talking about someone who just really does not like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has, and is entitled to, hisher own taste. But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for Titanic, pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of Titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point. Heavens Gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters ratings were 23.2 10 ratings and 9.2 1 ratings overall rating of 6.1.

Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.So our two main characters are Jack Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose Kate Winslet. They are not annoying too much but watch this and you will find out why they could become annoying  httptinyurl.comojhoyn . The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God no blasphemy intended, or just plain Caledon Hockley Billy Zane. Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews Victor Garberidk he was so nice, LovejoyDavid Warner, MurdochEwan Stewart, Lightoller Jonathan Phillips, Captain SmithBernard Hill, Molly BrownKathy Bates, and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett Bill Paxton. They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an 86 awesome","index":39,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies.

","The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God no blasphemy intended, or just plain Caledon Hockley Billy Zane. ","Combine all of the above and what do you get?! ","Oh yes! ","We get a love story on a sinking boat. ","The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite, Mr. ","Andrews Victor Garberidk he was so nice, LovejoyDavid Warner, MurdochEwan Stewart, Lightoller Jonathan Phillips, Captain SmithBernard Hill, Molly BrownKathy Bates, and many more. ","We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett Bill Paxton. ","They add something to the story, something good. ","The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. ","In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. ","The story is simple and it works. ","A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. ","She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. ","Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. ","Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. ","I give Titanic, an 86 awesome"]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <NP <NNP Titanic>> <VP <VBZ is> <NP <DT a> <ADJP <ADJP <JJ long>> <PRN <CC but> <S <ADVP <RB well>> <VP <VBN made> <NP <JJ tragic> <NN

voyage on the unsinkable ship. WriterDirector James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good onscreen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it is few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg.

favorite movies. It has its problems what movies do not but still, it is enjoyable.When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is wait a minute, you do not? I know so many people who do not like this movie, and I am not saying I do not see why. The love story is too cheesy well, yes but is not it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this does not actually exist. But this is a movie, does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.And finally, if one is going to complain that they do not like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I am sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. It is like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I have ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it is an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.I give this movie 1010, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.","index":42,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Titanic has to be one of my alltime favorite movies.

septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I do not think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85 of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and did not watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardos real nose? OK, I know that is silly to say, but I did rewatch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but Titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101yearold Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. She and her granddaughter Elizabeth Lizzy Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upperclass 17yearold Rose boards the ship with her fianc?, Cal Hockley and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, both of whom stress the importance of Roses engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the DewittBukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upperclass, Rose and her mother are financially broke. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy firstclass formal dinner of the rapportbuilding wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in thirdclass. But after Cals servant informs him of Roses whereabouts, Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again. However, after witnessing a woman encouraging her sevenyearold daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea, Rose defies him and her mother, asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from Cal. After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.They then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg. After overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal. Meanwhile, Cal discovers Roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jacks pocket. Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck, Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. Jack and Rose return to the top deck. Cal and Jack, though enemies, both want Rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ships first class staircase. Jack and Rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.So does Titanic live up to it is hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. But it has great acting, amazing effects, a wellwritten story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie did not get a lot of hype just because of Leos baby face or Kates amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. But all that aside, I do recommend this movie, it is a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.1010","index":46,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Back in 1997, do I remember that year Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets.

by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane. Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game. If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred. One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic. With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned. Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed. The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted. They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed. The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help. The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own. The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle. Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real. The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk. The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations. In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss. Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic. Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water. Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912. The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do. The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted. Everything of the time was very formal. Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie. Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken. The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives. Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night. In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic. Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored. This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed. As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done. To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage. This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.","index":49,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.

","He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown. ","As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations. ","In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. ","The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss. ","Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs. ","Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic. ","Furthermore, Mr. ","Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. ","The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. ","In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water. ","Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. ","All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. ","The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. ","The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912. ","The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. ","Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do. ","The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted. ","Everything of the time was very formal. ","Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. ","Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie. ","Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. ","Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. ","Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken. ","The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. ","The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives. ","Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night. ","In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic. ","Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored. ","This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. ","However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. ","There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed. ","As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done. ","To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. ","In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. ","Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. ","Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage. ","This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. ","At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. ","Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. ","Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. ","If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you."]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBP find> <S <NP <PRP it>> <ADJP <RB so> <JJ amazing>>> <SBAR <IN that> <RB even> <S <PP <IN after> <NP <PDT all> <DT these> <NNS years>>> <, ,>

Obviously this movie was not THAT bad or else people would not even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do! I guess this film is not for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. As for those that think that this film is overrated or overhyped...well, we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that! lol You see, it is not CRITICSarticle writers that make a film HUGE or a HIT with the general moviegoing public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let us face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really would not say that this movie was overhyped...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being overhyped. ha! Critics did not even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more! Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. Do not say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I have ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let us face it...the REAL star of the movie was not Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It is not thier best work I have seen much BETTER work from both of them but it was not the WORST I have seen on screen before.

Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an overhyped, overblown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards  even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. It was so great, she said. You really felt like you were on the ship. Nonsense, I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she will want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested. Well, maybe, thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. OK, I thought, I will give it a look see. I did not want to like it  and I did not. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First  the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You do not just watch it; you really do feel it. Then  the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack are excellent  Winslet us being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Roses mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then  the details. I am no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then  the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dions performance of My Heart Goes On.Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just do not accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he is been there for a while. The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.910","index":51,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I avoided watching this film for the longest time.

I will mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they are too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall yes, even more than Star Wars. And today, many people will not even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let us get something straight  you do not look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, flying. Iceberg, right ahead! The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the films success, was a key ingredient. James Horners score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it  in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I have had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.","index":53,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies.

we meet Julie Rebecca Gibney and Peter John Adam as they go out house hunting. They manage to get a loan for a fixerupper on a posh Sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. It just may be haunted.13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clich?d story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker.The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing. Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there is not much action. Suspense should be created from staging, not fancy fix it in the mix techniques. There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity. The tracking and the cuts need to be slow. The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked. As it stands, the scene has a strong made for television feel, and a low budget one at that.After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror 1979, though the budget forces a much subtler approach. Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.For some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue. The material is done well enough that it is often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if you have gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good. The performances help create tension. There is not an abundance of death and destruction in the filmthere is more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. But neither menace is really the point.The point is human relationships. There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. That it is in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems. Peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions. Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. It certainly is not worth spending 30 for a DVD that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling, but it is worth a rental, and it is definitely worth watching for free.","index":55,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century Australian street, we meet Julie Rebecca Gibney and Peter John Adam as they go out house hunting.

He has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance, and no one knows how he does it. He has a longing desire to have a grandson, as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir.

While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the books plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it is only slightly more touched upon than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?, but it is far superior to the film.

may not be the acme of literature or of film, but it is great entertainment in the quasimelodramatic mode. It is the story of love, both genuine and illicit, as well as overweening ambition, devotion, and the arrogance of personal tyranny. A previous reviewer, John Mankin, questions why the central focus of the film, the mansion called Elephant Walk, should have been built by the former owner, the governor the late Tom Wiley, right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water, the river. To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man. That his son, played by Peter Finch, should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father, is not unexpected, since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his fathers rowdy boys club as his role models. The point of the father was that he was a selfmade man who would tame nature to his liking, and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated, but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd, and thus he would dominate his son and all around him, and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water. Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water? This is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love? Ceylon, todays Sri Lanka, is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story, not just the expenses of Miss Taylor. Were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in Ceylon, and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler. One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place, as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the British raj. It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony, teak, and marble. Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors J. McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island. Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.For those immune to the blandishments of time, place, and architecture, there is always the allure of Miss Taylor, as she marries a man she does not really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man, against the background described, and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased. As I said, it is not great literature nor even great film, but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today.This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drivein, not on the home TV, so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camerawork and scope.","index":104,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film, but it is great entertainment in the quasimelodramatic mode.

Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain also known as Brenten, a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper. Britain did not like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special a giant green monster tank does not exactly endear her to him, nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a minitank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it. There is also Specs, the bifocal genius, Bible quotingGod fearing Chaplain, purple MOhawked Mohican, and the pot bellied Chief, who is right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics.

It is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours, and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema. There is no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature \u0096 particularly the human face and form \u0096 to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology. In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968, and, indeed, Bartletts opening sequence of images \u0096 flashing colours before a closeup human eye \u0096 recalls Dave Bowmans journey through the Stargate. The visuals are richlycoloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video, as though we are sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a TV monitor}.There appears to be some confusion about the films release date. IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year. Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening. Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music would not have gone amiss, either! OffOn captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information. I had a thought \u0096 and please do not laugh at this freethinking interpretation \u0096 that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that could not possibly make any coherent sense. Perhaps this is where Mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.","index":111,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Scott Bartletts OffOn is nine minutes of pure craziness.

For Om Puri its first breakthrough in mainstream Hindi cinema  he delivered a class performance as Inspector Velankar.

Shafi Inamdar was truly a discovery for me  he is a brilliant character actor if given a chance  here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even Om.

Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings. His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain. I hoped, and was delighted to find, that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life, rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise. From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr.What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Eds. We get insight into Eds personal and professional life from his romances, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his film making.The film itself is shot in a lowbudget way that seems done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President. The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems Crossroads of Lorado and photo galleries, but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse, to the point where one woman will go down in history as Swimming Pool Owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool. This ability to define a persons legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created. Somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.Even the title hints at the Blist horror genre, but by the end, we see that even this is a kindness. What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Woods legend.In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint. This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get. Being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling.","index":126,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I loved this film.

fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uberconventional realm. It is a yakuzatriad picture, involving cops versus Japanese or Chinese gangsters mostly Chinese, as the title suggests, but already even in his first technical debut, Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from hereon in. Social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and ones roots, which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2; thumbingofthenose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rapeviolence towards women; bloodcurdling violence. It is certainly not as surreal as some of Miikes most recent films, but this is expected as he is trying out things that he is just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers. It is got all of those qualities, and it is also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans.The story concerns two brothers, one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan, Tatsuhito Kiriya Kippei Shiina, pretty decent as a Eastwoodesquire antiherohero, who is become a detective, and another, who is become a gangster, or a wouldbe one. The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its sparetime, played by Tomorowo Taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes, and his partner Karino Takeshi Caesar, who is threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who is just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal, who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a Miike movie. There is some intrigue involving the organtrading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gangs penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want. It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it will not come off.If it does not add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it is par for the course of a film like this. Miikes goals are met, though just met, in his lowscale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents, notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime, and what the realm of unrepentant sex, with both sexes, brings out psychologically in the characters. At the same time, Shinjuku Triad Society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting blackcomedy from the Miike oeuvre. Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area. There is even a laughoutloud line from the young sexslave after finishing an act on one of the bosses Thank you, Mr. WeenyBurger. Miike and his writer do not have enough here to make the film a fullon dark comedy like Ichi or, of course, Visitor Q, but there is enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.As the first entry of the Black Society trilogy, as it is called, I was quite impressed, and it is a fine quasicalling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.","index":138,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uberconventional realm.

and I thought this sort of description might have been a clich?. But, like all clich?s, it is based on the truth. All the Miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character. Shinjuku is however, one of Miikes most perfectly formed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film. As you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that. The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past. I cannot sing Shinjukus praises enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitanos Sonatine. The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you will be popping it back on again to work it all out.","index":140,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true Miike film and I thought this sort of description might have been a clich?.

Cliff is distracted  crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road. Cliffs airbag works OK  he walks away with minor injuries, unfortunately for Abby hers did not  she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car  doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body. Abbys life is saved, just. She is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured  horribly disfigured from the burns. Cliff decides that she should die, his selfish lawyer Ira Corbin Bersen thinks they should let Abby die, sue the car manufacturer  get rich while Abbys mum Pam Linda Sorenson wants to blame Cliff, get rich  save Abby. However Abby has other plans of her own...This American Canadian coproduction was directed by Rob Schmidt whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn 2003 which on it is own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of Horror episode  was episode 9 from season 2 of the Masters of Horror TV series, while I did not think Right to Die was the best Masters of Horror episode I have seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same  still does not come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution 2006. The script by John Esposito has a neat central idea that is not anything new but it uses it effectively enough although I would say it is a bit uneven, the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over Abbys life  the affair Cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory  twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart. The characters are a bit clich?d, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum  the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is OK, the story moves along at a nice pace  overall I liked Right to Die apart from a few minutes here  there where it loses it is focus a bit  I was not that keen on the ambiguous ending.Director Schmidt does a good job  there are some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere  outandout blood  gore. There are some fantastic special makeup effects as usual, there is shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body  the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images  makeup effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser 1987  it is sequels, then there is the main course at the end where Cliff literally skins someone complete with closeups of scalpels slicing skin open  him peeling it off the muscle  putting it into a cooler box! Very messy. There are also various assorted body parts. There is some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked...Technically Right to Die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant  as most Masters of Horror episodes it does not look like a cheap madeforTV show which basically if the truth be told it is. The acting was fine but there is no big names in this one.Right to Die is another enjoyable  somewhat twisted Masters of Horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene! Well worth a watch... for those with the stomach.","index":149,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Masters of Horror Right to Die starts late one night as married couple Abby Julia Anderson  Ciff Addison Martin Donovan are driving home, however while talking Cliff is distracted  crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road.

entirely sure Rob Schmidt qualifies as a Master in the genre of horror, since he previously just directed one horror film called Wrong Turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre, but fact is that he made with Right to Die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the Masters of Horror franchise. There was a similar underdog story in season one, when William Malone made on of the best episodes with The Fair Haired Child even though his other long feature films Fear Dot Com and House on Haunted Hill sucked pretty badly.The story of Right to Die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple oldfashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery, the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident. Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney Corbin Bernsen of The Dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, Abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff. Meanwhile Abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices. After a few victims, Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well. Right to Die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TVseries concept like Masters of Horror. It is violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences. The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks, which is always a welcome plus, and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a meanspirited and egocentric bastard.

When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live. The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt, who made Wrong Turn a film I have not seen. With only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, I was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting Schmidt to be a Master of Horror in only the most liberal sense. My apologies to him for my underestimation. As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet.The issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device. However, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves. Once the horror elements show up, the film goes from decent to spectacular. Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense. I was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance! I read a review of this episode prior to watching it, where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of Hellraiser in this. Through the first part of the show, I had no idea what they were talking about. Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of Hellraiser 2. However, I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film. I can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than Hellraiser 2.Some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look. I did not watch it a second time, but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had not that it is confusing. The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if I felt bad for him. He is somewhat of an antihero to the whole story, if you will. I feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he is completely unlovable.While the Stuart Gordon episode may be better and I am excited about the Washingtonians episode, I think I could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine. When legends like John Carpenter let me down again I get a bit worried about the genres future, but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt comes along and gives me hope. This one is a keeper, and please bring Schmidt back for season 3!","index":154,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident.

Most on this channel, whether set there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L.A. etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian locale.But if there ever were one deserving the top rating  10 on this site, it is this movie. Certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one. It is also been done pretty often on the big screen, with megastars, past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al  and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and many more. I can think of at least 1012 more, just as prominent, past to present, off the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.Not to drone on, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre I have seen. I caught it by chance on a midday Friday, at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week. I would never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made. And, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman Annas mother whom I would seen in some things from her younger days, and Michael Rispoli Henry, Charlies best friend who was outstanding as Gramma, the menacing juice loan, tough, street guy from Rounders. The chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends, as a substory romance, with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later, is an oftdone plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact, it enhances it.Checking some other comments, I agree completely with those which are the most positive. The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.I love films with a harder edge Rounders; the escapist SchwarzeneggerStallone fare; Goodfellows; even the classics like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane. But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding. With a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by You have Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle. And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the costars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these megafilms, as well.","index":164,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I would have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a Lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story  here, New York City.

good, though not wonderful, film made back in the early Nineties, a whole franchise can grow. Stargate; SG1 is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shouldertoshoulder with Star Trek as the kings of scifi.Following on from the 1994 feature film Stargate, this series sees Stargate command a militaryscience organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore. SG1 is one such team, headed by military veteran Colonel Jack ONeill, and includes archaeologist Doctor Daniel Jackson, military scientist Captain Samantha Carter and alien Tealc, who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people. Earth quickly makes an enemy of the Goauld, a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods.The topnotch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life. Richard Dean Anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic ONeill, who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye.

","Stargate; SG1 is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shouldertoshoulder with Star Trek as the kings of scifi.Following on from the 1994 feature film Stargate, this series sees Stargate command a militaryscience organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore. ","SG1 is one such team, headed by military veteran Colonel Jack ONeill, and includes archaeologist Doctor Daniel Jackson, military scientist Captain Samantha Carter and alien Tealc, who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people.

The films were aimed at servicemen and were directed, animated and scored by some of the top talent from Warner Bros. Termite Terrace, including Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, and Carl Stalling. The invaluable Mel Blanc supplied the voice for Snafu, and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by Theodor Geisel, i.e. Dr. Seuss. The idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery, using the character of Snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope, the little twerp who would do everything you are NOT supposed to do. According to Chuck Jones the scripts had to be approved by Pentagon officials, but Army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes, certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow all for the greater good, of course.As the title would indicate, this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors. The setting is an Army camp. Private Snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine something you will not see in any other Hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling. We observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted, then exaggerated, then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp. The imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot, while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air, i.e balloon juice. A soldier shoots his mouth off, cannonstyle, and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction. Winged baloney, at that. Panicked soldiers tell each other that the Brooklyn Bridge has been pulverized, Coney Island wiped out, enemy troops have landed on the White House lawn, and the Japanese are in California. The visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for Rumoritis and Private Snafu has been locked up in a padded cell.This is a highly effective piece of work. The filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy, and the message is still a valid one. In recent years we have seen that catastrophic events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances. Because the technology has improved, the Private Snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via email, cellphones and blogging. Consequently, RUMORS is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message does not feel at all dated; in fact it may be more timely than ever.","index":192,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["RUMORS is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring Private Snafu.

and The Vanishing. One of the Dutch writers more recent works is De Grot, a psychological thriller about two totally different men, Egon and Axel, who meet at a youth camp and, surprising enough, become friends for dear life. Egon is a quiet, somewhat dull person, who spends his time studying and writing geography books. Axel, on the other hand, is a charismatic partyanimal, a heavy drinking criminal whose everydays concern is to get a woman into his bedroom. From the moment they meet, Axel has a strong influence on Egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like Egon; ultimately, Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian country.After having read the book last year, I was surprised the critics were quite positive about it. In my opinion, the book suffers especially from the complex structure. While Krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people, the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically, so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode. Because of this, the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a characters background to really care for him or her. Another complaint was the fact that the main characters, Egon and Axel, are a little stereotypical. Egon IS the dull intellectual, while Axel IS his exact opposite. In real life, such onedimensional people rarely exist; in books and films, they always seem to be there, taking away a lot of credibility.Despite all this, the film was a pleasant surprise, being much better than the book.

The drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the books mainly because the characters are onedimensional, they are so predictable that it becomes annoying. Guess who wrote the script?

based on the book written by Tim Krabb?. Another of his books, Het Gouden Ei was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called Spoorloos The Vanishing in 1988. This one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the American remake also called The Vanishing but there are times it comes close.Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn his name is Egon Wagter Fedja van Hu?t, coming from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this.From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flashforward. We see how Egon, still as a child here played by Erik van der Horst, befriends a guy named Axel as a kid played by Benja Bruijning. We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel as an adult played by Marcel Hensema became a criminal. Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time he sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him.The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their midthirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults.Minor spoilers herein.The title means The Cave, and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the end. It is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.","index":196,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["De Grot is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabb?.

A story about a womans fight against harsh injustice.The story of the film revolves around Nandini Karisma Kapoor who lives in Canada with her two uncles Tiku Talsania, Jaspal Bhatti. There she meets Shekhar Sanjay Kapoor, falls in love with him and they soon marry. Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy, Raja Master Jai Gidwani. But their happiness is short lived, as the news of Shekhars ailing mother Deepti Navalmakes them leave their perfect life in Canada and come to India. And that is when the problems start. From the moment they reachIndia, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere. They take a crowded train to reach Shekhars village and when they finally reach the station, they have to catch a long bus drive to his village. The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a neverending drive. And unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus. Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him. After that, they drive to the handing Havel where Shekhars father, Narsimha Nana Patekar lives with his wife Deepti Naval. Nandani realized that her fatherinlaw is in command as soon as she enters the place, but her only solace is her motherinlaws warm welcome.Living there, Nandini learns of her fatherinlaws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him. The day she sees her fatherinlaw teach her son to throw a bomb, she loses it and lashes out against him, insisting to Shekhar that they move back to Canada. But terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel fatherinlaw. Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heartwrenching film.What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie. The only drawback is Ismail Darbars music, which fails to rise above the script. The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena, which has been composed by Anu Malik. Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast. Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother. She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal. Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film. His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he is shown his versatility once again with this role. Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors. Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Prclimax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy. Shahrukhs cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he is been pulled in to get the required star value. Though his role was not really required, he is done it well. Overall, Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Prrelease hype is sure to get it a good opening. Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up. So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact.

However, I am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. This picture has everything any movie could ever have. It has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist selfconscious art film. It is all in there, adding up to a myth.The basic premise is about an Indian couple, Nandini Karishma Kapoor and Shekhar Sanjay Kapoor, happily living in Canada, who rush to India to visit the husbands parents after a disturbing news report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. At one point, the story borrows from Not without my baby, but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice.The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khans dream of Aishwarya Rai which comes as if out of another movie. In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character. Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the films twists and turns with a show of believable emotion. Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar. Nana Patekar dominates every scene he is in with a scary but nuanced character.The movie is not without its share of realism. Violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with Karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions. At times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic.I have seen a share of Bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. But Shakti raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a Shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained. It is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book. Perhaps, the allimportant message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but I came out of watching Shakti exhilarated.

The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja. All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to India. When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhars family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his fathers enemies. When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. Here starts the intense struggle which can be called Nandini vs. Narasimha.India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct. The portrayal is in my view fair and not onesided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshis direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. One thing that must be noted is the very earpleasing background score by Ismail Darbar, it is beautiful. The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film. Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.The films biggest strength is the performances. Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini. Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance. One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha. He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. He is outstanding. Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from Indias most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief. Anyway, do watch Shakti  it could have been better, but it is definitely a mustwatch.","index":208,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mothers love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script.

one. I have never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way, but having a strong feeling. The movie was disturbing at moments. However, the movie was terrible at editing. The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place. Like Karisma is getting beat up, and the same time SRK is fighting comically with the police officers. The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place. On top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning. The direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about.I have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely. Without them, this movie would not have an impact. Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza. She looks pretty in the first half, and I have never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her. What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date. Nana Patekar was excellent as her fatherinlaw. Not much to say about him, besides this is a role made for him. Deepti Naval as the motherinlaw was excellent especially in her final scene. Though she does not have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good. The other good performance was the little kid. He was adorable, and is sure to bring tears to the viewers eyes. The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances. Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he did not have much to do. Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role. One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina. The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song. And boy Aish is mad hot. However, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever. People may have come to the movie for Aish, but they will not brag too much about it afterwards. Hum Tum Miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie. Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about. Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie. Despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see.","index":209,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["If any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills, this is probably the one.

Karisma Kapoor is excellent as an Indian woman in Canada who marries a friend Sanjay Kapoor, has a child, and then visits his family in India only to find they are terrorist warlords. Drama and tragedy ensue, and the film becomes a kind of NOT WITHOUT MY BABY styled thriller. Film is compelling, its few songdance numbers are uninteresting and needless, the gaity of Bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this films drama, at least once we have left the comforting confines of their Canadian love nest \u0096 although one number involving a cameo by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is enjoyably provocative, if ultimately misplaced as well. Likewise, the inclusion of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan as a happygolucky drifter who helps Kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce, and it only gets back on his feet when his character \u0096 and his fantasies about Rai that generate her cameo dance \u0096 are dispensed with. His throwaway comicbook dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the films primary gripping drama. The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord, and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his longsuffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the films best scenes; Ritu Shivpuri and Rajshree Solanki are also very good as Sanjays sisters in India, and very pleasing eye candy. But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious adlibs. The directorial style of writerdirector Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good. The musical underscore is also quite effective, moody, featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto SHAKTIs soundtrack cd, but Bollywood has not yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums, at least not in most cases. But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoors film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes. Despite the unevenness of much of the picture, Karismas performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures. In a strange way, also, I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty I would noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE, both of which I would seen just prior, although SHAKTI of course is an entirely different kind of film; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family \u0096 here living in the austerity of terrorismcontrolled poverty in India rather than the elegance of Versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal Chinas Tang Dynasty \u0096 whose selfserving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext.","index":211,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Uneven Bollywood drama.

and John Entwistle.The Original Drum and Bass.There seems to be very little early Who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be aving it, nowadays it tends to be of a very different kind of Who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their much better years. To be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they have earned their respect and with overtime.This concert footage for me is one of their best. To command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of bloody good music.We all know of the other acts on the bill, The Doors their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died, Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point being that whoever were there it was The Who that the majority had come to see. This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960s; Woodstock. The film and record had come out and so had The Who is greatest work to date, Tommy. The ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to Grove and Love in the knowledge that this gig was their own. To do this you needed the best of what Rock n Roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd.At two o clock in the morning in late August 1970 the M.C. announces, Ladies and Gentlemen, a small Rock n Roll band from Shepherds Bush London, the OO.John Entwistles body suit is of black leather, on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassels and long flowing hair, Keith in a white tshirt and jeans, as Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins that he would preferred to wear.The Who never stopped their onslaught of High Energy Rock for over two hours, performing theirs and other artists greatest tracks such as Young Man Blues, Shaking all Over, and then as on queue, Keith baiting the crowed to Shut up, it is a bleeding Opera with Tommy, the Rock Opera. The crowed went wild. This is what they had come to hear, and the Who did not disappoint, straight into Overture and never coming up for air until the final note of Tommy can you Hear me? Amazing.To capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a Festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the World was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History.The English DVD only comes in a soundtrack of EnglishLinear PCM Stereo, were as in the States, I think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, Check local press for details\u0085 on that, okay.The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a slice of Rock and Festival History this DVD would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best Who concert footage as it was meant to be, Live, Raw and in your Face!I would have given this DVD ten if it was not for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice.Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith.","index":214,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle.The Original Drum and Bass.There seems to be very little early Who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be aving it, nowadays it tends to be of a very different kind of Who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their much better years.

","The point being that whoever were there it was The Who that the majority had come to see. ","This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960s; Woodstock. ","The film and record had come out and so had The Who is greatest work to date, Tommy. ","The ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to Grove and Love in the knowledge that this gig was their own. ","To do this you needed the best of what Rock n Roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd.At two o clock in the morning in late August 1970 the M.C. announces, Ladies and Gentlemen, a small Rock n Roll band from Shepherds Bush London, the OO.John Entwistles body suit is of black leather, on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassels and long flowing hair, Keith in a white tshirt and jeans, as Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins that he would preferred to wear.The Who never stopped their onslaught of High Energy Rock for over two hours, performing theirs and other artists greatest tracks such as Young Man Blues, Shaking all Over, and then as on queue, Keith baiting the crowed to Shut up, it is a bleeding Opera with Tommy, the Rock Opera. ","The crowed went wild. ","This is what they had come to hear, and the Who did not disappoint, straight into Overture and never coming up for air until the final note of Tommy can you Hear me? ","Amazing.To capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a Festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the World was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History.The English DVD only comes in a soundtrack of EnglishLinear PCM Stereo, were as in the States, I think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, Check local press for details\u0085 on that, okay.The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. ","Yes, for a slice of Rock and Festival History this DVD would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best Who concert footage as it was meant to be, Live, Raw and in your Face!","I would have given this DVD ten if it was not for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice.Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith."]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <NP <DT This>> <VP <MD would> <VP <VB have> <VP <VBN worked> <ADJP <ADJP <NP <DT a> <RB lot>> <JJR better>> <SBAR <IN if> <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBD had> <VP <VBN been> <VP <VBN made> <PP <IN as> <NP <NNP Mitchell>>> <PP <IN in> <NP <NNP Malta>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <ADVP <IN At> <JJS least> <RB then>> <NP <PRP we>> <VP <MD would> <VP <VB have> <VP <VBN been> <VP <VBN spared> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN sight>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <NNP Joe> <NNP Don> <NNP Baker>> <VP <VBG running> <PP <IN around> <NP <NP <DT an> <ADJP <RB otherwise> <JJ scenic>> <JJ Mediterranean> <NN locale>> <VP <VBN clad> <PP <IN in> <NP <NP <DT that> <JJ ridiculous>> <VP <VBG looking> <NP <NP <NN cowboy> <NN outfit>> <: ...> <CONJP <RB not> <TO to> <VB mention>> <NP <NP <VBG acting>> <PP <IN like> <NP <DT an> <JJ Old> <NNP West> <NN gunslinger>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <S <NP <NNP Mitchell>> <VP <VBG being> <NP <NNP Mitchell>>>> <, ,> <NP <DT the> <NN film>> <VP <MD would> <RB not> <VP <VB have> <VP <VBN suffered> <PP <IN from> <NP <NP <DT a> <NN lack>> <PP <IN of> <NP <JJ gratuitous> <NN police> <NN brutality>>>>> <ADVP <CC either>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <VP <NP <INTJ <UH Oh>> <NP <RB well>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <ADVP <IN At> <JJS least>> <NP <NP <DT the> <JJ comic> <NNS comments>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NNP Mike> <CC and> <DT the> <NNPS Bots>>>> <VP <VBD made> <NP <DT this> <ADJP <JJ enjoyable>> <NN fare>> <PP <IN as> <NP <NP <DT an> <NN episode>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NNP MST>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <MD can> <RB not> <VP <VB imagine> <S <VP <VBG watching> <NP <PRP it>> <PP <IN on> <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <JJ own>> <, ,> <ADVP <RB however>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>"],"txt":"This would have worked a lot better if it had been made as Mitchell in Malta.

was broadcast on Showtime. A spinoff of and sequel to the 1994 film Stargate starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film. For ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG1. Originally, the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack ONeill two ls!, Michael Shanks as Dr. Daniel Jackson, Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter, Christopher Judge as Tealc and Don S. Davis as Major General George S. Hammond. For ten long years, we watched the team battle against the Goauld, the Replicators, the Ori and many other aggressors. At the same time, they forged alliances with the Asgard, the Tokra, the rebel Jaffa, the Nox and the Tollan. They saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them. And sometimes not even then.As with all longrunning series, they were numerous cast changes. Michael Shanks left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor. Daniel Jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was Jonas Quinn, an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara, played by Corin Nemec. However, Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June 2003 and Nemec left at the same time. Unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards. Don S. Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go. The show is original star and arguably its most popular actor, Richard Dean Anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons. His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons. He finally left SG1 in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter. Jack ONeill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.The ninth season represented a new era for the programme. With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goauld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high. Regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goauld as the series main adversaries. Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention. Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1. His Farscape costar, the lovely Claudia Black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran, a former Goauld host and con artist from another planet. A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season. Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack ONeill and General Hammond. For the last two years, they starred alongside the SG1 faithful Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise.Alas, all good things must come to an end. During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its August 2006. After ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over. On March 13, 2007, what began with Children of the Gods ended with Unending. The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the SciFi Channel in the United States on June 22, 2007.In the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, Star Trek, in terms of popularity in certain countries. It became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world, second only to Doctor Who 19631989, and the longestrunning American produced scifi series, having surpassed The XFiles only a few months before it ended.Stargate SG1 represents the cornerstone of the Stargate franchise. In 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled Stargate Atlantis, which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008. Although plans for another feature film fell through, two directtoDVD films, Stargate The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum, were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future. A third liveaction series, Stargate Universe, is also due to premiere at some point next year. There was, unfortunately, an animated series, Stargate Infinity, which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better. Despite the end of SG1 and Atlantis as continuing series, the future of Stargate looks very bright indeed.In conclusion, while Stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as Star Trek and Doctor Who, its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.","index":221,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["On Sunday July 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called Stargate SG1 was broadcast on Showtime.

I just found DVD of Yank Tanks there, great doc, but how sad for it to end up as a rockbottom remainder.I loved this film, wish I would seen it at the cinema in it is everything. I would have preferred that New Yorker Films had translated the title directly. It is good for Americans to stretch a little. If the films title helps the US audience to explore random chaos, all the better. Cinema imitates life  visa versa.Also, I found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars. Come on!

wormhole.Having seen this series sporadically for it is first few seasons when it first came out, I did not know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I had last seen an episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. Stargate SG1 is more than just a simple scifi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting scifi ever produced. And why? Because it runs on an amazing premise.This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that does not work on the time restriction of film. The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it is all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.Stargate SG1 kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show  The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goauld threat.  From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goauld and preventing attacks on Earth. After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg1 in a place of Goauldreplicatorori conflicts The 8th season is probably the most mixed one. It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments.  The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack ONeil. They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG1 and humanJaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planetepisode presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it is a little hard to find that it ends. The big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG1.","index":233,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Stargate SG1 follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG1 through a device called the Stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.Having seen this series sporadically for it is first few seasons when it first came out, I did not know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I had last seen an episode.

to avoid too may characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who. This is especially true in film, I think, simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema. Viewers like myself, however, do not have that problem because we see all our films on DVD or VHS.A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain 2001 and later in A Very Long Engagement 2004, both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters. This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity.Now, other directors have used those techniques before Robert Altman with The Player 1992, Short Cuts 1993, Gosford Park 2001 and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia 1999. Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is, first the director lets us see inside the head of some of the characters and second, some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewers memory as the story flipflops between different time periods.The basic \u0096 the core, so to speak \u0096 story concerns a young woman, Irene Tautou who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day. This occurs in the first few minutes of the film. The clever irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that the young man opposite Gilbert Robin may be that one true love. And, nor does he...They go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter. However, chaos results throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere, and yet...If the story were simply that, it could tend to be boring, and even quite predictable. Not so. The script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace, but which are turned into believable, extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. For example, the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again. Or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen? Consider again what would happen...All of that is interesting enough. What was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train. That kept me guessing for a while.I will let you think about that, should you see this delightful romp.Recommended for all.","index":235,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Narratives \u0096 whether written, visual or poetic epics \u0096 generally try to avoid too may characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who.

The French title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects. From the start, the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the films context seems to work well.A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film.

","The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings.We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected."]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <S <PP <TO To> <NP <PRP me>>> <, ,> <NP <DT this> <NN review>> <VP <MD may> <VP <VB contain> <NP <NNS spoilers>>>>> <, ,> <CC but> <S <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBP like> <S <VP <VBG watching> <NP <NNS movies>> <PP <IN with> <NP <NP <NN NO> <NN idea>> <PP <IN of> <SBAR <WHNP <WP what>> <S <VP <VBZ is> <VP <VBG going> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB happen>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <, ,> <RB so> <S <ADVP <RB therefore>> <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBP think> <SBAR <S <NP <NP <JJ many>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <DT the> <JJ other> <NNS reviews>> <PP <ADVP <RB here>> <IN of> <NP <DT this> <NN movie>>>>>> <VP <VBP contain> <NP <NNS spoilers>>>>>>>> <. !>>>","<ROOT <S <S <NP <PRP I>> <ADVP <RB just>> <VP <VBD watched> <NP <DT this> <NN movie>> <ADVP <RB again>>>> <, ,> <CC and> <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <MD must> <VP <VB reiterate> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ has> <NP <NP <DT the> <NNP BEST>> <VP <VBG ending> <PP <TO to> <NP <DT any> <NN movie>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <FRAG <ADVP <RB Ever>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <FRAG <ADVP <RB Ever>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <FRAG <ADVP <RB Ever>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <NP <DT The> <JJ real> <NN translation>> <, ,> <NP <NP <DT The> <NN Beating>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT the> <NNPS Butterflys> <NNPS Wings>>>> <, ,>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADVP <RB oddly>> <RB not> <ADJP <VBN used> <PP <IN as> <NP <DT the> <VBN translated> <NN title>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBP suppose> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP they>> <VP <VBD thought> <ADVP <RBS most>> <SBAR <S <NP <NNPS Americans>> <VP <MD would> <RB not> <VP <VB know> <SBAR <WHNP <WP what>> <S <NP <NNP Chaos> <NNP Theory>> <VP <VBZ is> <PP <IN except> <IN for> <NP <NP <DT those>> <SBAR <WHNP <WP who>> <S <VP <VP <VBD saw>> <CC or> <VP <VBD read> <NP <JJ Jurassic> <NN Park>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <DT The> <NN movie>> <VP <VBZ is> <VP <VBN based> <UCP <PP <IN on> <NP <NN chaos> <NN theory>>> <, ,> <CC and> <SBAR <WHADVP <WRB how>> <S <NP <CD one> <JJ small> <NN event>> <VP <MD can> <VP <VB affect> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN outcome>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <ADJP <RB seemingly> <JJ unrelated>> <NNS events>> <, ,> <SBAR <WHNP <WDT which>> <S <NP <DT all>> <VP <VBP lead> <ADVP <RB back>> <PP <TO to> <NP <CD one> <NN event>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <DT The> <NN movie>> <VP <VBZ is> <NP <NP <DT a> <JJ whirlwind>> <PP <IN of> <NP <JJ wondrous> <NN cause> <CC and> <NN effect>>>> <, ,> <SBAR <IN as> <S <NP <PRP we>> <VP <VBP follow> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN chain>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NN chaos>>>> <SBAR <IN as> <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ intertwines> <PP <IN between> <NP <NP <JJ several> <NNS characters>> <PP <IN about> <NP <CD 20>>>>>>>>>>>> <. ?>>>","<ROOT <S <PP <IN In> <NP <DT a> <NN way>>> <, ,> <S <NP <DT the> <VBG ending>> <VP <VBZ seems> <ADJP <JJ inevitable> <PP <IN despite> <NP <DT this>>>>>> <, ,> <CC but> <S <SBAR <IN if> <S <NP <PRP you>> <VP <VBP think> <PP <IN about> <NP <PRP it>>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ is> <NP <DT a> <JJ perfect> <NN ending>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <SQ <VP <VB Think> <PP <TO to> <NP <NP <PRP yourself>> <, ,> <SBAR <WHNP <WP what>> <S <ADVP <RB else>> <VP <VBD needed> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB be> <VP <VBN said>>>>>>>>>>> <. ?>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP It>> <VP <VBZ is> <PP <IN at> <NP <DT the> <JJ same> <NN time>>> <ADVP <DT a> <RB very> <SBAR <S <VP <VBP brave> <S <VP <VBG ending>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <ADJP <RB Too> <JJ bad>> <NP <PRP we>> <VP <VBP have> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB go> <ADVP <RB overseas>> <PP <IN for> <NP <NP <DT a> <NN gem>> <PP <IN like> <NP <DT this> <CD one>>>>> <, ,> <PRN <CC but> <NP <DT an> <S <VP <VBG ending> <SBAR <IN like> <S <NP <DT this>> <VP <MD would> <ADVP <RB NEVER>> <VP <VB come> <PRT <RB out>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NNP Hollywood>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>"],"txt":"To me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies with NO idea of what is going to happen, so therefore I think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers!I just watched this movie again, and I must reiterate that it has the BEST ending to any movie.

The pilot, Jim Norton John Bromfield, goes to work for Valerie Craig Kathleen Hughes who soon coerces him into helping her wrest control of the estate from her troubled sister, Lorna Sara Shane and the family lawyer Jess Barker. Valerie wants Norton to seduce Lorna when he is not fending off the advances of another sister, the nymphet Vicki Marla English, but her plans are thrown into a tailspin when Norton falls for his prey. All bets are off as a world of woe including corporate chicanery, seductions, suicides, blackmail, a murder plot, the Mann Act, doublecrosses, disfigurement, and poetic justice befall Craig Manor, an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea...This preposterous potboiler would have made a perfect second feature for WRITTEN ON THE WIND, also from 1956. Douglas Sirks saga of a powerful and powerfully dysfunctional oil clan was said to have inspired the 1980s nighttime TV serial DALLAS but the Craigs lowbrow excursion into insanity seems right out of it is sinful sistersoap, DYNASTY. All three siblings only one of whom is really bad are great beauties but it is Kathleen Hughes cartoon villainy that stands out. Valerie is relentless in her quest to inherit the family fortune and her unbridled enthusiasm for evil is one of the movies many guilty pleasures.

duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in The Angel Levine. It is one interesting twist on the themes from It is A Wonderful Life.Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly Jewish poor in New York. Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. He is reduced to applying for welfare. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he cries out to God for some help.Now maybe if he had gotten someone like Henry Travers things might have worked out differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers.

","Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working. ","Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. ","He is reduced to applying for welfare.

was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the good ol bootleg market I was able to find a copy pretty easily, and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually, dare I say, decent.Decent for what it is, actually, namely a cheesy giantmonster flick. It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately, and we get introduced to various characters. They consist of some sleazy ones, some good ones, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy scifi film, by far.Yeti looks like a longhaired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, he is not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cagelike thing. Godzilla he is not  despite his rude awakening, he does not even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture, but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out. Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in English and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are.However, we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing, and he is pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical lowbudget fashion, he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there is even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there.Yes, the special effects are not the greatest, but there are definitely some good ones here. A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well, and in another, he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it  shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside  in one sequence that really looks much, much better than it should in such a bad movie.Yeti never stoops as low as say, A.P.E. does. Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yetis nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner. But even this is not that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer.The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it does not get boring  the story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy.Yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other King Kong 76 ripoffs like A.P.E. and Queen Kong by very far.","index":253,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Being a giant monster fan, me seeing Yeti was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it.

the galaxy Andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity. This movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a ripoff of the already bad movie classic KING KONG from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness, but successfully predicted much of Peter Jacksons miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name, as far as a romance between the giant here a Yeti and a gorgeous human female Antonellina Interlenghi of Umberto Lenzis CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, who is very easy on the eyes.The film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex  the Yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package, the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness. But as a tradeoff you DO get a wacky old scientist, two inquisitive kids, Tony Kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain, a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure Dog Adventure movies were big in Europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the Yeti, who turns out to be the good guy, glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands, a monster who is size literally changes scale from shot to shot, some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in GODZILLA VS THE SMOG MONSTER look tame by comparison, crowd reaction shots aplenty made up of either Spanish, Italian or Canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed, and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie.It is here that the film won me over It is enthusiasm just for being made. Frank Kramer is actually the same Gianfranco Parolini who brought the world SARTANA in 1968 and GODS GUN the year before this  was a very important director in the Spaghetti Western and actionadventure genre film scene from the 1960s1970s and by the time of YETI he was probably delighted to get the work. I would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever, or rather the one he took the most chances with, and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families. The movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless. Or rather they are part of the fun, and if the movie had been played seriously it would not have worked  WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY PETER JACKSONS MOVIE SUCKED. He forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid Power Macintosh pod people animators, and with all it is faults  clunkiness, Kramers YETI is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this, which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages, not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space. I would rank this up there with KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA and IT! CURSE OF THE GREAT GOLEM as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever. Because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked, trampled, tossed about and smashed. Knowing that and armed with a fertile, energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie, Parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie I will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend. This is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid.1010, it is about ten minutes too long but who cares, you only come around once and I would rather go out with a smile on my face.","index":257,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Heres another movie that should be loaded into a satellite, fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy Andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity.

flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites. It does not wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. Kids will definitely love it and will not mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film. None of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. I will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screweyess deathwhich still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side. But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. The music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most indepth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. Martin Shorts clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells Screweyes I quit! had me in stitches. My favourite is Screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent. If anything though, I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could have been more developed in terms of depth. The script, while not Oscarworthy, has its funny and heartwarming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. The voice acting for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to Kenneth Mars for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable. All in all, this is a good movie. I do not get the rating, honestly I do not. Sure this film is not perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time, but it is good fun. 7.510 Bethany Cox","index":268,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I do try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites.

this when it first came to video, my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time... What stood out for me was the lack of midmovie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just do not say the one thing that you are shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say. This is what I like the most about the movie I guess, that the main characters do not do mean things to each other halfway through... they do not break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they are not that different. Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone. Anyway, I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again... sure there is plot holes if you analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb should not be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.Now, what detracts from the film is it is unexpected scariness. Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes. And, the addition of him halfway through the movie though it is blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie, perhaps to show that it is not that scary without the the dinosaurs. I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.Considering the target audience, who I am sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues... I think I will give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story. It is a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think.","index":269,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I saw this when it first came to video, my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time...

Movies these days are now all about sound effects, leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with CGI blood. There still are movie makers who still cannot get fake blood to look like the real thing. There is no rape scene because that was not the point of making the film.

","just ask Charlie Sheen This is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick! ","Like I said pure underground. ","Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror, or foreign gore. ","If your not I highly recommend you readup on the series before watching! ","From the gore, shock, and creativity aspect it gets a 10, but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1.

But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene.

It was not until after season 5 that I started to see the richness of the show. They finally brought Daniel Jacksons search for his wife to an end and finally most of the Go,ould System Lords were killed by rival Lords, SG1 or others.Towards Season 5, Stargate SG1, was beginning to become stale. With the new writers and the close attention by Produer Peter Deleuise, the show became more and more solid.The characters had become stale as well. Colonel Jack ONeill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident with ONeills weapon, he had decided to end his own life by going to Abydos in order to face off with the Goould RA. The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only allowing his close friends in.Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter. She was a feminist on the edge, ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job. Though this character had little area to grow, Tapping has done a great job of concentrating on Carters strengths. She has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently. Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Tealc. Tealc was an alien called the Jaffa. Infant Goould, snake like creatures would embed themselves into the Jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form. The Jaffa would die. Tealc was the First Prime of Apophis army. Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Goould pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy. Finally, having had enough, he and Jack ONeill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people. After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the Goould. Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character. Tealc is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher Master Bratac. The show would not be complete without Master Bratac played by Tony Amandola. He is also a rock. In the end, he became adviser to most of SG1, especially Daniel Jackson. Don S. Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General George Hammand. Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal. He does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. You can really say, he is the anchor of the base. Simply, I would die for that man. If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world. He will go himself. He does not leave anyone behind.I saved Dr. Daniel Jackson for last, because this character, I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on. In choosing Shanks I do not think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now when people talk about Jackson, they do not talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks. In the early years, the Jackson character came off as a whiner. That is why I probably was not a fan. As the seasons pasted, the character became stronger. This gave him confidence. In the end, as of season 10, the Jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero. He still monitors the groups ethics. He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward. Acheaology, History, Culture and Exploration are part of his very being. He is determined. Though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement. Other characters include, most recently Vala Mal DoranClaudia Black and Colonel Cameron MitchellBen Browder, new lead of SG1. Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess. I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton Farscape character. Blacks character is simply off the wall. Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon.","index":277,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I have not always been a fan, but the show grew on me.

Wonderful. My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films. We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America. Now before you ask why am I writing a review? Instead ask why some people bash it. I am writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films. Why do I love em, it is because they go for the throat and they do not let go. I have seen it all. Almost every horror film known to man, Argento, Fulci, Bava, Buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster. I have seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films. Why because it does not try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place. This review is for the Devils Experiment. I find it devoid of story which is fine by me. Why do I watch horror films? So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people. The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that is all it is. Pure unadulterated violence. Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold. Why do people bash it. Cause they like a story, so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story. It make em feel better about themselves. We all want blood and gore. It is just really hard to justify it if it is not wrapped around a story. The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.I am thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world. Maybe I should not have written this review but then again maybe I should. My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it is not. I have always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films. Sure it is exploitive and over the top but is not that why we watch horror films in the 1st place. The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody. It is for thrill seekers and gorehounds only. If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those. But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you. There is a reason why they have not been released for over 17 years. They are wrong, disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom, unless she is totally cool.

Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining. Devils Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects worknot just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realisticespecially for the videos vintage and lowbudget.Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know This film is an extreme torturefake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid80s. It is plot as it stands is simple A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. This entails brutal violenceall effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girls arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings.The actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera. Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling.

","Devils Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects worknot just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realisticespecially for the videos vintage and lowbudget.Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know This film is an extreme torturefake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid80s. ","It is plot as it stands is simple A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. ","This entails brutal violenceall effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girls arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. ","These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings.The actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera. ","Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling. ","Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest. ","Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack

I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year. Boy, was I in for a surprise. This was one of the smartest, most wellwritten movies I had ever seen.The screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out, but also in terms of character development. On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamets screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film. I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset.

for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 910 was enough to take the heart out of the show.The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.RDA gives his ONeill character believable personality. He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. Still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.There is a lot going on between Carter and ONeill under the surface. They manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. The episode Solitudes in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.Carter and Jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by ONeill. Yet ONeills tactical instincts always seem sound. He understands what to do without having to think about the matter. The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.The spinoff Stargate Atlantis has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. The villains Wraiths are so improbable as to be ludicrous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it will not last beyond the fourth season.There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in SciFi. The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultramodern technology is just as hard to accept.I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. In the season 2 opener, Daniel Jackson is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. The episode Hathor has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC, yet it is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes on Daniel, ONeill, and Dr. Frasier.","index":299,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1.

The film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; it is still difficult to guess where it is going, and every twist comes off as a surprise. As mentioned, I am a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler. She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con.House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his films setting in the underground levels of the city. The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill. Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he is always solid and believable as the villain of the piece. Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role. She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. The way that the film executes it is plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. At times it is almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film. Another thing that is great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if you are interested in making twenty bucks, say.

From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was.There were a few movies I have seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of games is completely different in it is way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I have seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying. You know somethings going to happen but you have no idea what. And just when you think you have guessed what the something is, you realize you have not even scratched the surface....House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature. The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well. As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it is conclusion.In closing, I would rank this 10 of 10, call it although not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list, most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists I have ever seen as well. Although I love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to movies of the human psyche, it really does not get much better then this.

It is like The Grifters, but without that films level of acting. In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character. The acting here is very flat I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis. At least in the beginning. It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouses lines  the way she reads them  sound as if they are inner monologue or narration, which they are not. With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be. I was expecting crackerjack ringadingding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones do not. It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. He is far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What is more strange is that other than this, the film does not look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed.I would not mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines  or even play characters speaking play lines  but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines. It is a weird jumble of theatre and film that just does not work. That does not mean the movie is bad  it is not, it is often extremely entertaining. The best chunk is in the middle.It is standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case, girl Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. I will admit the setup is pretty improbable. Were they just expecting Crouse to come in? Were they expecting she would write a cheque? Was Billy in on it? One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.And from here the cons are start to roll out. I found the beginning ones  the little learner ones  to be the most fun. We are getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is. We see the ending coming, and then we did not see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I did not see coming but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.I am going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange linereading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. After the halfhour mark it does really get a momentum going. If you want a fun con movie, then here she is. If you want Mamet, go watch Glengarry Glen Ross again  James Foley did him better.","index":312,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Heres my first David Mamet directed film.

It stars Lindsay Crouse as bestselling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels downtown to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.The gambler Mike played excellently by Joe Mantegna turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. He offers Crouses character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he will cancel the patients debts. The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the conman or is it the wellknown man of great bluffs David Mamet.In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads showy and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of Mamets work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. House of Games can also be viewed as a classwar division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middleclass, welltodo educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by honest crime.The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it is stunning.An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 910","index":315,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["The United States of Kiss My AssHouse of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller.

dark world of the confidence game. Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse has a successful practice and has written a bestselling novel, Driven. Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there is an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability. When a patient, Billy Hahn Steven Goldstein, confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they are going to kill him if he does not pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf. This takes her to the House of Games, a seedy little dive where she meets Mike Joe Mantegna, a charismatic conman who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. Instead of the twentyfive large that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she will agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the tell of one of the other players. By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. The dialogue, and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing. As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her. From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a tell is and how it works, to the lessons of the short con, to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. And nothing is what it seems. In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself. She changes; and whether or not it is for the better is open to speculation. Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does. Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, uptight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, selfassured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well. The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum Joey, Lilia Skala Dr. Littauer, J.T. Walsh The Businessman, Ricky Jay George and William H. Macy Sergeant Moran. House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; he is written and directed a number of highcaliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. You will find it under Perfection. This is one great movie you do not want to miss. I rate this one 1010.","index":316,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with House of Games, a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game.

","When a patient, Billy Hahn Steven Goldstein, confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they are going to kill him if he does not pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf. ","This takes her to the House of Games, a seedy little dive where she meets Mike Joe Mantegna, a charismatic conman who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. ","Instead of the twentyfive large that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. ","And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she will agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. ","In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the tell of one of the other players. ","By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. ","The dialogue, and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing. ","As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her. ","From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a tell is and how it works, to the lessons of the short con, to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. ","And nothing is what it seems. ","In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself. ","She changes; and whether or not it is for the better is open to speculation. ","Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does. ","Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, uptight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, selfassured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. ","She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well. ","The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum Joey, Lilia Skala Dr. ","Littauer, J.T. ","Walsh The Businessman, Ricky Jay George and William H. ","Macy Sergeant Moran. ","House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; he is written and directed a number of highcaliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. ","But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. ","You will find it under Perfection. ","This is one great movie you do not want to miss. ","I rate this one 1010."]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <NP <DT This> <NN movie>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <JJ amazing>>> <. !>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <IN While> <S <VP <VBG being> <ADJP <JJ funny> <CC and> <JJ entertaining>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ is> <UCP <ADJP <RB also> <RB profoundly> <JJ deep>> <CC and> <NP <NN eyeopening>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <MD will> <VP <VB watch> <NP <PRP it>> <ADVP <RB again> <CC and> <RB again>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <NNP Bruce>> <VP <VBZ is> <NP <NP <DT a> <NN guy>> <SBAR <WHNP <WP who>> <S <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <JJ unhappy> <PP <IN with> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN life>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <S <NP <PRP He>> <VP <VBZ has> <NP <NP <DT a> <NN job>> <CC and> <NP <DT a> <NN life>>>>> <, ,> <CC but> <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ is> <RB not> <SBAR <WHNP <WP what>> <S <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VBZ thinks> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <MD will> <VP <VB take> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB bring> <NP <PRP him>> <NP <NN happiness>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <NNP Bruce>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <ADJP <JJ bitter>> <, ,> <ADJP <JJ unsatisfied>> <, ,> <CC and> <ADJP <JJ resentful>>> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <PRP$ his> <NN life>> <VP <VBZ is> <RB not> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN way>> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VBZ envisions> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <MD should> <VP <VB be>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <PP <IN As> <NP <NP <DT a> <NN result>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <DT this> <NN state>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NN mind>>>>>>> <, ,> <NP <NNP Bruce>> <VP <VBZ ends> <PRT <RP up>> <S <VP <VP <VBG losing> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN job>>> <CC and> <VP <VBG blaming> <NP <NP <NNP God>> <PP <IN for> <NP <NN everything>>>> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VBZ thinks> <SBAR <S <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <JJ wrong> <PP <IN with> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN life>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <NNP God>> <VP <VBZ comes> <PP <TO to> <NP <NP <NNP Bruce>> <CC and> <NP <NP <NP <NNS grants>> <NP <PRP him>> <ADVP <RB Godly>>> <NP <NNS powers>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <NNP Bruce>> <VP <VBZ uses> <S <NP <DT these> <NNS powers>> <VP <TO to> <VP <VB get> <NP <NP <NN everything>> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VBZ has> <ADVP <RB always>> <VP <VBN wanted>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP$ His> <NN life>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADVP <RB finally>> <SBAR <WHADJP <RB exactly> <WP what>> <S <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VBD envisioned> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <MD would> <VP <VB take> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB make> <S <NP <PRP him>> <ADJP <JJ happy>>> <: ...> <PP <IN with> <NP <CD one> <NN exception>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <PP <IN In> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN process>> <PP <IN of> <S <VP <VBG gaining> <NP <NN everything>>>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VBZ loses> <NP <NP <DT the> <CD one> <NN person>> <SBAR <WHNP <WP who>> <S <ADVP <RB truly>> <VP <VBD loved> <NP <PRP him>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <S <SBAR <IN As> <S <NP <DT the> <NN movie>> <VP <VBZ unfolds>>>> <, ,> <NP <NNP Bruce>> <VP <VBZ learns> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <NP <DT the> <JJ real> <NN change>> <SBAR <WHNP <WDT that>> <S <VP <VBD needed> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB occur> <PP <IN in> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN life>>>>>>>>>> <VP <VBD was> <RB not> <NP <DT the> <NNS circumstances>>>>>>> <, ,> <CC but> <S <NP <NP <PRP$ his> <NN perception>> <PP <IN of> <NP <WP what>>>> <VP <VBD was> <ADVP <RB truly>> <ADVP <RB there>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <DT This> <NN movie>> <VP <VBD was> <ADJP <JJ inspirational> <CC and> <JJ deep>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <IN If> <S <NP <PRP you>> <ADVP <RB really>> <VP <VBP pay> <NP <NN attention>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ forces> <S <NP <PRP you>> <VP <TO to> <VP <VB look> <PP <IN at> <NP <NP <PRP$ your> <NN life>> <PP <IN with> <NP <NP <DT a> <ADJP <RB deeply> <JJ humbling>> <NN respect>> <PP <IN for> <NP <DT the> <NN fact>>>>>>> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <NP <DT a> <NN lot>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT the> <NN time> <PRP we>>>> <VP <VBP are> <ADJP <ADVP <RB so> <RB much> <RBR more>> <VBN blessed> <SBAR <IN than> <S <NP <PRP we>> <VP <VBP recognize>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <IN As> <S <NP <PRP$ my> <NN wife>> <VP <VBZ says>>>> <, ,> <SBAR <IN Since> <FRAG <SBAR <WHADVP <WRB when>> <S <VP <VBZ does> <NP <NN anybody>>>>>>> <VP <VB know> <SBAR <WHNP <WP what>> <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ takes> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB make> <S <NP <PRP them>> <ADJP <JJ happy>>>>>>>>>> <. ?>>>","<ROOT <FRAG <CC and> <NP <NP <PRP$ my> <JJ humble> <NN addition>> <, ,> <NP <NP <NP <NNP May>> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP we>> <RB not> <VP <VB lose> <NP <PRP ourselves>>>>>> <CC and> <NP <NP <DT those>> <SBAR <WHNP <WP who>> <S <VP <VBP matter> <SBAR <IN while> <S <NP <PRP we>> <VP <VBP try> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB find> <PRT <RP out>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>"],"txt":"This movie is amazing!

It is not preachy, it is not anchored by it is moral, it should not be controversial. It is just God. Any possible God, no matter the religion. And it is really funny.Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself more or less TO himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job. This drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grace Jennifer Aniston away. When the final straws are executed, he is quick to not laugh, but yell in the face of God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he is guilted into helping others, where he then continues to miss the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground.OK, that was kinda long. But as a plot, it works well. The stepbystep fashion in which we meet the challenges of being God is much better than clustering his problems together, and is able to hide itself fairly well.As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, Carreys pitchperfect acting stays in character which, luckily enough, is him, and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene. Whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him, the humour would turn flat, as humour is half execution. And the humour is very good in the first place. But without Carrey, it would kinda feel like a It is a Wonderful Life wannabe.Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act. At least, you do not think that when you see her. She gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you are watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple.The movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand, has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save Carreys career which was not goin anywhere..","index":341,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I really do not know what people have against this film, but it is definitely one of my favourites.

","The stepbystep fashion in which we meet the challenges of being God is much better than clustering his problems together, and is able to hide itself fairly well.As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, Carreys pitchperfect acting stays in character which, luckily enough, is him, and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene. ","Whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. ","Without him, the humour would turn flat, as humour is half execution. ","And the humour is very good in the first place. ","But without Carrey, it would kinda feel like a It is a Wonderful Life wannabe.Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act. ","At least, you do not think that when you see her. ","She gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you are watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple.The movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand, has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save Carreys career which was not goin anywhere.."]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <SQ <ADVP <RB Well>> <, ,> <VBD was> <NP <NNP Morgan> <NNP Freeman>> <ADJP <ADVP <DT any> <JJR more>> <JJ unusual> <PP <IN as> <NP <NP <NNP God>> <PP <IN than> <NP <NNP George> <NNP Burns>>>>>> <. ?>>>","<ROOT <S <S <NP <NP <DT This> <NN film>> <ADJP <JJ sure>>> <VP <VBD was> <ADJP <ADJP <JJR better>> <SBAR <IN than> <S <NP <DT that>> <VP <VBD bore>>>>>>> <, ,> <FRAG <INTJ <UH Oh>> <, ,> <NP <NNP God>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBD was> <VP <VP <ADVP <RB totally>> <VBN engrossed>> <CC and> <VP <NP <NNP LMAO>> <ADVP <NP <PDT all> <DT the> <NN way>> <IN through>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <S <NP <NNP Carrey>> <VP <VBD was> <ADJP <JJ perfect> <PP <IN as> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN out>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NNS sorts> <NN anchorman> <NN wannabe>>>>>>>> <, ,> <CC and> <S <NP <NNP Aniston>> <VP <VBD carried> <PRT <RP off>> <NP <PRP$ her> <NN part>> <PP <IN as> <NP <NP <DT the> <JJ frustrated> <NN girlfriend>> <PP <IN in> <NP <PRP$ her> <ADJP <JJ usual> <RB well> <S <VP <VBN played>>>> <NN performance>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <, ,> <PP <IN for> <NP <CD one>>> <, ,> <VP <VBP do> <RB not> <VP <VB consider> <S <NP <PRP her>> <VP <TO to> <VP <VB be> <ADVP <CC either>> <ADJP <JJ ugly> <CC or> <JJ untalented>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBP think> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP$ my> <JJ favorite> <NN scene>> <VP <VBD was> <SBAR <WHADVP <WRB when>> <S <NP <NNP Carrey>> <VP <VBD opened> <PRT <RP up>> <NP <DT the> <NN file> <NN cabinet>> <S <VP <VBG thinking> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <MD could> <ADVP <RB never>> <VP <VB hold> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN life> <NN history>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <S <VP <VB See> <SBAR <IN if> <S <NP <PRP you>> <VP <MD can> <VP <VB spot> <NP <DT the> <NN file>> <PP <IN in> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN cabinet>> <SBAR <WHNP <WDT that>> <S <VP <VBZ holds> <NP <NP <DT the> <NNS events>> <PP <IN of> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN bathroom> <NN humor>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBD was> <VP <VBG rolling> <PP <IN over> <NP <DT this> <CD one>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <INTJ <UH Well> <PP <VBN written> <NP <NP <NP <QP <CC and> <RB even>>> <VP <ADVP <RBR better>> <VBN played> <PRT <RP out>>>> <PRN <, ,> <S <NP <DT this> <NN comedy>> <VP <MD will> <VP <VB go> <PRT <RP down>> <PP <IN as> <NP <NP <CD one>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT this> <NNS funnymans>>>>> <ADVP <RB best>>>>>>>> <. .>>>"],"txt":"Well, was Morgan Freeman any more unusual as God than George Burns?

Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore.Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I will give you the low down.Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace Anniston, and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building heh. There he meets God Freeman, who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT.Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruces.Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line 3.5 out of 4 worth a view or two","index":345,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Starring Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie.

back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously, his good will towards his fellow man backfires. In that case, it was not too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should not be ignored. I am reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. The results were not very promising, so it is nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart. Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film. Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that is seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie. He is desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague. You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report. Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freemans massive talent as an actor. He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life. I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day. There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion. I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live. But despite the fact that I do not believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he is come. If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved, by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it is amazing how far he is come. He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever. Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him. There is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that does not really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Venturas friend Spike make a cameo appearance. As Stephen King very well knows, it is always nice to see familiar characters. It is almost like seeing family again.Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him. The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers. The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records, the scene where Bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking. The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God who reveals that he is the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home! I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlaw.Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection. It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained. This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy, it is nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. Do not miss this one.","index":346,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck.

Examination Day is set in the future, year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves, huge TVlooking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age...and the Examination Day, a point where 12yearolds must undergo a governmentrequired IQ test. The kid is this story, Dickie Jordan David Mendenhall is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid, so is calm, even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades. His parents Christopher Allport and Elizabeth Norment, on the other hand, say he should not have used his birthday wish on getting a good score, and while their reason includes that they believe he is capable and he should have no need to worry, it is pretty obvious they are worried. I will not give anything away in the ending, but I will say this  there is a point where we get a glimpse of what is to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another? his parents ask Dickie whether he would prefer to watch TV all night. By todays standards, we would be pleased he would say he would rather read and not just because there is nothing worth watching...but why would his family ask this? The flavor of what is encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon which I hear has not received a great adaptation to the screen. I only wish they could have provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was. I found it to be better than the short story it was based on. I have not read the one that A Message from Charity was based on, but would like to since it was interesting  a 16yearld boy, Peter Robert Duncan McNeill is suffering a fever from unclean water, that has always been common in his Massachusetts hometown...but he is able to see through the eyes of a young Puritan woman suffering the same type of fever, Charity Payne, Kerry Noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him. They both recover, especially since it is common for that to happen in 1985, but the connection does not go away. Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each others company, especially Peter, who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students, even at the college he is been staying in one place at. Things take an unexpected turn, though, when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment, added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in 1700. The two try to learn a way to save her. The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching. Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times, through a lessonwarning that sounds like something Rod Sterling would have cooked up and entertainment, make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship, love, and wisdom do a great deal. Probably 34 of this has no theme, but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterlings crew.","index":350,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories I note both of them are based on short stories.

It appears that the grim realities of a Nation caught up in the aftermath of this Economic Disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace. A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball.Likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the Cinema. The presence of a Radio in just about everyones house hold kept Depression Era America at once attuned to Worlds Events and provided many a Drama and especially Comedy Shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.The literature of the time also flourished at all levels. The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the Comic Book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself. There were mediums that were ancestral to them. Obviously,the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visualnarrative method of story telling.The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine. The inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales. The pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borroughs TARZAN and Johnston McCulleys ZORRO. The 1930s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8s BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER,MASTER of MEN all found their way to the news stands, among many others.One other was DOC SAVAGE, a fullblooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only picture of the hero. Possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, Doc was the prototype Super Hero.He also assembled 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a given field. So we had a top rated Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineer, GeologistArchaeologistPaleontologist, etc.The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s, and were published into the middle 50s. Then they went into a hiatus for a good 1215 years. Then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container, the paperback book. A fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt.The reintroduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month and for a while more. Soon, there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie! But when, by what Producer? Well, the venerable Man of Bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together. It was veteran Stopaction Animator and Producer of top Special Effects films, Geoprge Pal, who did the film along with Warner Brothers.When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE arrived in the Movie Houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely No Name as far familiarity with the viewers. With former Tarzan of TV,Ron Elys nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran character Paul Wexler as the villainous, Captain Seas; no other name would have been recognized. And, just maybe that was a plus in this case.The story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going. Use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.From the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured Camp humor as the Batman TV series. Some really great looking early scenes involving Doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the Paul Frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes. For Example, an experiment of Docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that. The whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little Camp every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. We are also puzzled about Mr. George Pals being the Producerhis last. He who had been so well known for Special Effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the Pulp Characters world.I can remember seeing it quite vividly. Mrs. Ryan Deanna was in the Hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, Michelle081475. Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her Grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the Maternity Ward, it was straight over to the old Marquette Theatre, 63rd  Kedzie, here in Chicago.Having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was sort of let down by the final product. I could accept a little of this Camp business, but would not have objected if Mr.Pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to give it all a little more PulpComicSerial type excitement.And yet, the cast, headedup by Mr. Ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable. The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a 30s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.And maybe that is just what they were trying for with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.","index":353,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression.

It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did the Goauld Ras race come from? How many are there? The first episode has a retired Jack ONeill spelled with 2 Ls recalled to active duty by General George Hammond due to an attack by the shut down Stargate from Apophis, a powerful Goauld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the Stargate the first time, and is determined to go through now. We find out that Daniel got married on Abydos, and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial. Then Daniels wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC which includes nine teams, in which Jacks team will be SG1 which consists of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, a Goauld homeworld to rescue Daniels wife and another one captured at Abydos named Skara. They get captured, and just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Tealc, First Prime of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is made part of SG1. That was only the beginning of the adventure. In the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of Goauld called the Tokra, in which Samanthas Dad becomes a member, the Asgard, a cute little race in which we see Thor most often he is Jacks buddy,and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.The show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons. In season nine, a new enemy called the Ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the Stargate and its creators, the Ancients. Season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team. Very wellproduced, interesting characters, fantastic Special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all.

movie. Thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on!, a cluelessly unromantic Doc Savage he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps, not an idiot, Monk Mayfair in a nightsheet a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights, and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar statute. And when they are not doing booming Sousa march scores, the tinkly little funny music undercuts much of the drama.Even as such, this movie is...okay. It is fun, and when it stays serious it is a very accurate representation of the pulps. Except for Monk, as has been mentioned before he is hugely muscled, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an inexplicable scarf.The Green Death sequences, for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something I would recommend for children. But they are very close to the feel of the pulps. When the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right  I will give them that.But if the producers had done Doc with the loving care and scripting of, say, Reeves first two Superman movies, think what we might have had then. I think the problem is the movies schizophrenic. There is a definite sense of trying to do a 30s homage, but they are also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that Batman created. One gets the impression there was a sober, pulpstyle first draft and then someone came in and said, Hey, let us make it funny  it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!But Doc lives on, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai.

Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there\u2019s no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff, here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as Noel Langley though it\u2019s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison. As can be expected, much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment \u2013 though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely Naunton Wayne, Wilfrid HydeWhite and Felix Aylmer the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled \u201CThe Colonel\u2019s Lady\u201D. While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the runningtime, it\u2019s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain.\u201CThe Verger\u201D tells of a church sexton James Hayter \u2013 for which the story\u2019s title is another word \u2013 who\u2019s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest Michael Hordern simply because he\u2019s illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife his landlady, played by Kathleen Harrison but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered \u2013 and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of Hayter\u2019s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were \u2013 to which the wealthy and respected tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger! The second episode, \u201CMr. KnowAll\u201D, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man Nigel Patrick, British despite his foreignsounding name of Kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid HydeWhite are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most \u2013 the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick\u2019s attentions to his pretty wife Anne Crawford. During a fancydress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their revenge\u2019 on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him a jest which he naturally doesn\u2019t appreciate!; still, it\u2019s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character \u2013 told by Crawford that the necklace she\u2019s wearing is an imitation, Wayne challenges Patrick to name its pricebut the latter realizes immediately that it\u2019s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford\u2019s position if he were to tell, so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! As can also be deduced from the title, \u201CSanatorium\u201D deals with the myriad patients at such a place \u2013 run by Andre Morell; the protagonist is a new intern, Roland Culver, who wistfully observes the various goingson. The narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot \u2013 one humorous the feud\u2019 between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie, one melodramatic the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and longsuffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies and one bittersweet the romance between na?ve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a lifer\u2019 while Rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar.","index":363,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Given the title, this first followup to QUARTET 1948 obviously reduces the number of W.

quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by Maugham. Here the three stories are THE VERGER, MR. KNOWITALL, and SANITORIUM. The first two are comic THE VERGER is like a prolonged joke, but one with a good payoff, and the last more serious as health issues are involved. Again the author introduces the film and the stories.James Hayter, soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick, is the hero in THE VERGER. He holds this small custodialtype job in a church, but the new Vicar Michael Hordern is an intellectual snob. When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him. Hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife Kathleen Harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop. He has a good eye, and his store thrives. Soon he has a whole chain of stores. When his grandchild is christened by Hordern, the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his exVerger. The payoff is when bank manager Felix Aylmer meets with Hayter about diversifying his investments. I will leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting.According to Maugham he met a man like Max Kelada Nigel Patrick on a cruise. In MR. KNOWITALL Kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly overbearing type from the Middle East who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship. His stateroom mate is Mr. Grey the ever quiet and proper Wilfred HydeWhite who is somewhat, silently disapproving of Max. Max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ships entertainment. At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the nonMaugham story and film CHINA SEAS 1935, as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real. I will not describe the way Max rises to the occasion.SANITORIUM is the longest segment. Roland Culver plays Ashenden the fictional alterego of Maugham  a writer and one time spy as in Hitchcocks THE SECRET AGENT. Here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health. He finds a remarkable crew of people, including Jean Simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman, Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman, John Laurie as a second irascible Scotsman who is at war with Currie, Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and Michael Rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness. Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions. The last, dealing with Simmons and Rennie, is ironic but deeply moving.It was a dandy followup to the earlier QUARTET, and well worth watching.","index":368,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Made after QUARTET was, TRIO continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by Maugham.

These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama.All in all, the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars secondtier actors.

Alexander Knox,  Wilhelm GimmGorky Park returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town.

AfricanAmericans. It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay. It would seem that Redd Foxxs RF wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at the store back in Phoenix. He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door. Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge. It was just to the point where I wrote WHY will not he wake up? when suddenly he does, and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed, swirlhairdoed Garson, Normans white livein lover, who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream\u0085 Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 L.A. He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch.Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit. Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls. So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico. While he is on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him. With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we are about to hear a very special track by The Emotions, he realizes that his son is gay.His first impulse is I will kill him. I will kill him. Then RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon. His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man. Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought. He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all! RF then hires Audrey, a sixfoot Amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody.Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night. He commiserates over the loss of RFs wife, and tells the tale of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because she was molested at a luau. They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam, which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose. Once more, mouths were agape.So it seems that, would not ya just know it, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together! You see, staid, traditional older black men just have to see the crappy, highlyeffeminate entertainment of megaqueens in order to come around to ALL the gay world has to offer! It is really JUST that simple! This still does not prevent RF from yelling Rape! when Garson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you would think.There was so much that was just off. WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson s relationship? They do not seem to have ANY rapport, and Norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking Garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship. There were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like RF going to buy all those books on homosexuality\u0097and sitting right down on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends.Other than that, it is kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance, we could all learn to love and understand one another! And because of the whole naivet? of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and messageladen dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years. I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with, and by extension convert, them.

","But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hypernationalism to do despicable things.Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they cannot even be bothered to vote.A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be  a force for the betterment of humanity  and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals.Geoff"]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <SBAR <RB Even> <IN though> <S <NP <DT this> <NN movie>> <VP <VBD came> <PRT <RP out>> <NP-TMP <DT a> <NN year>> <SBAR <IN before> <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBD was> <VP <VBN born>>>>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADVP <RB definetely>> <NP <NP <CD one>> <PP <IN of> <NP <PRP$ my> <JJ favorite> <NNS comedies>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP It>> <VP <VBZ stars> <NP <NP <NNP Redd> <NNP Foxx>> <PP <IN as> <NP <NP <DT a> <NN father>> <SBAR <WHNP <WP who>> <S <VP <VBZ tries> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB understand> <NP <PRP$ his> <NNS sons> <NN homosexuality>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <PP <IN Like> <NP <JJS most> <NNS parents>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VP <VBZ does> <RB not> <VP <VB know> <NP <DT a> <NN thing>> <PP <IN about> <SBAR <WHNP <WP what>> <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ means> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB be> <ADJP <JJ gay>>>>>>>>>>> <CC and> <VP <VBZ has> <NP <NP <DT all>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <DT these> <JJ stereotypical> <NNS notions>> <PP <IN of> <SBAR <WHNP <WP what>> <S <NP <JJ gay> <NNS people>> <VP <VBP are> <PP <IN like>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <NP <PRP$ His> <NN son>> <, ,> <NP <NNP Norman>> <, ,>> <VP <VBZ is> <VP <ADVP <RB now>> <VBN grown> <UCP <ADVP <RB up>> <CC and> <VP <VBG living> <PP <IN on> <NP <PRP$ his> <JJ own>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <WHADVP <WRB When>> <S <NP <NP <PRP$ his> <NN father>> <, ,> <NP <NNP Ben>> <, ,>> <VP <VBZ finds> <PRT <RP out>> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <PRP$ his> <NN son>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <JJ gay>>>>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VBZ pays> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN son>> <NP <NP <DT a> <NN visit>> <PP <IN in> <NP <NP <NNS hopes>> <PP <IN of> <S <VP <VBG changing> <NP <PRP him>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <S <NP <DT The> <NN title>> <VP <VBZ comes> <PP <IN from> <NP <NP <CD one>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <DT the> <JJS funniest> <NNS lines>> <PP <IN in> <NP <NP <DT the> <JJ moviewhen> <NNP Ben>> <SBAR <S <VP <VBZ gets> <PP <TO to> <NP <NNPS Normans> <NNS apartments>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <NP <PRP he>> <VP <VP <VBZ runs> <PP <IN into> <NP <DT a> <JJ female> <NN prostitute>>>> <CC and> <VP <VBZ thinks> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ is> <NP <NP <PRP$ his> <NN son>> <PP <IN in> <NP <NN drag> <NNP Norman>>>>>>>>> <: ...>>>","<ROOT <S <VP <VBZ Is> <ADVP <IN that>> <NP <PRP you>>> <. ?>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <DT The> <NN movie>> <VP <VBD had> <S <NP <PRP me>> <VP <VBG laughing> <PP <IN from> <NP <NN start>>> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB finish>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <NNP Redd> <NNP Foxx>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <JJ great>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <S <SBAR <IN Although> <S <NP <NP <DT a> <NN lot>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT the> <NN content>>>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <JJ stereotypical>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBD did> <RB not> <VP <VB find> <S <NP <NN anything>> <ADJP <JJ offensive> <PP <IN about> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN way>> <SBAR <S <NP <DT the> <NN material>> <VP <VBD was> <VP <VBN handled>>>>>>>>>>>> <, ,> <CC and> <S <NP <PRP it>> <ADVP <RB even>> <VP <VBZ has> <NP <DT a> <JJ good> <NN ending>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <VP <ADVP <RB Highly>> <VBN recommended>> <. .>>>"],"txt":"Even though this movie came out a year before I was born, it is definetely one of my favorite comedies.

","While much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, at times it is both subtle and penetrating, playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film, but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene."]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <NP <DT This> <NN movie>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <RB very> <JJ good>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <DT The> <NN screenplay>> <VP <VBZ is> <VP <VBG enchanting>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <CC But> <NP <NNP Meryl> <NNP Streep>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <RBS most> <JJ impressive>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP$ Her> <NN performance>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADJP <JJ excellent>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP She>> <VP <VBZ brings> <S <NP <PRP me>> <VP <TO to> <VP <VB go> <PP <IN into> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN heart>> <PP <IN of> <NP <PRP$ her> <NN role>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>"],"txt":"This movie is very good.

While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just did not ring true. It sounded more like antiFascism speeches than the voices of real children. They were as a result extremely annoyingparticularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat.

review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based.The right to be presumed Innocent until proven guilty is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society; but according to Fred Schepisis partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous Australian murder trial, it was not granted to Lindy Chamberlain, accused of killing her baby. The story suggesting her innocence was unlikely a dingo was alleged to have taken it, but those implying her guilt even more so, and there was no solid evidence against her. But the Australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt, and the deeply religious Chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media and the media themselves, of course, were anything but innocent in this process. So although cleared by an initial inquest, they were later prosecuted and convicted. Although Chamberlain was eventually released, this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence proving their innocence, something no defendants should have to produce.A Cry in the Dark is well acted throughout, especially by Meryl Streep, who puts on a convincing Australian accent at least to this Poms ears and manages keep Lindy sympathetic to us while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure. The scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking, because we believe in the characters as real. Regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story something I cannot comment on, the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the British popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readerships least charitable instincts.

DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film. This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streeps Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, wellconstructed on every level. If you ask me, this is an underappreciatted classic.The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlains at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi the director selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy Streep and Michael Sam Neill Chamberlain care for their children.While the famous line A Dingo Took My Baby! has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable. The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions.The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlains continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder.The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping. As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlains plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media. But at the same, the mediapublic opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way. For me, this ranks as one of if not 1 Meryl Streeps best performances. For all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right, Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. I find this to be one of Streeps more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streeps performance. From what I have seen, this is undoubtedly Neills finest work to date. It is a shame he was not recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streeps... bc the two of them play of each other brilliantly.More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful... A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams The dingo took my baby! watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one line....

of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood. What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area. Noone believed them. Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael as an accessory after the fact. The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing. The Chamberlains trial was over before it began.Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure. How could we as a nation even sit in judgement? From where we are, how could we possibly presume to know? Unless there was absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt whatsoever, the Chamberlains should have been acquitted.Fred Schepisis film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of John Brysons novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them. That in fact a dingo did take baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock.Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on the truth being brought to light. He shows Australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay! His screenplay, cowritten with Robert Caswell, vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred.The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts. She brings to life most convincingly the tough little Aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight. Even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on. A very good effort by the master of that trade. Sam Neill is every bit as good as Streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned Michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart, and he starts to question his Christianity. His, as was Streeps, is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly. The entire support cast are also excellent, with some of Australias finest actors and actresses playing a part.Technically the film is brilliant too, with Director of Photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the Rock. Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a telling score.For all Aussies this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror if you will, at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served, and the truth to be known. As Michael Chamberlain said  I do not think anybody really understands what innocence means.....to innocent people.Saturday, May 20, 1995  VideoEven on return viewings Fred Schepisis account of the travesty of justice that befell the Chamberlains, who lost baby Azaria at Ayres rock in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving.Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly transferred John Brysons novel to the screen, telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose new born daughter Azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down.Amid media speculation and vicious public rumour Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael was charged as an accessory after the fact. What followed was little more than trial by media, and with the Australian people determined she be put away, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence.Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles Australia head on to prove her innocence. She is truly awesome, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent, though she does her level best to sound ocker. You might wonder why a top Australian actress was not cast in the role, but star power is probably the answer. Alongside Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes, while he feels powerless to do anything about it. A strong Aussie cast lend compelling support.Editing from Jill Bilcock is very timely, Ian Bakers cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeatons music is perfect for the part. Truly a must for all conscientious Australians.Sunday, June 15, 1996  Video","index":395,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation.

The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better. But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their lifes tragic disarray, the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip, news media, crowds, mobs and assumptions. It is not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular; it is merely an account of a true story that happened there. Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigines dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of ones own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround ones life. The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses.The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jetfueled mostly by a virtue of hers. To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter. Why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for TV and the press? How much of the downward spiral could have been prevented had she behaved more to the publics liking in the media? Meryl Streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out, and frankly neither does any other actor, or department of filmmaking. But she, and the screenwriters, do understand Lindy. What is infuriating is that it is not that difficult. Apparently, she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case. Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense, we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation.Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophies Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Angels In America or other such work, it is a triumph. It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself. She frustrates us because we do not know what she is thinking or feeling. It took me awhile to feel endeared toward her, but this is the movies way of suggesting the reaction of the publics attention.She is married to a pastor, and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most. Initially, they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to Gods will, kickstarting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughters death was some sort of ritual killing on their part. Whatever happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the medias intake did not immediately identify, so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry...well...Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen, but the Australian public plays the real leads here. Like punctuation for each plot advance, director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office, where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections.This GolanGlobus docudrama is not particularly memorable. The settings atmosphere does not give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out.

Streep and her husband Michael Sam Neill have just welcomed a baby girl, Azaria. As Seventh Day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon have Azaria dedicated to God at their church, with their two older boys looking on. Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to Ayers Rock, one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of Australia. Not being wealthy, the family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying. As Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. Although the entire camp looks for the baby, she is not found. Concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child, the Chamberlains struggle to accept Gods decision and go on with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that Lindy murdered the baby. She is subsequently arrested and put on trial. How could this happen? This is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination. The entire country turns against the Chamberlains, in part because they are seen as odd. Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy, whose own strongwilled demeanor works against her every step of the way.

finish it of Platos run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10"]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <S <NP <DT A> <NN wrongdoer>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADVP <RB often>> <NP <NP <DT

wrongdoer is often a man that has left something undone, not always he that has done something.Emperor Marcus Aurelius The DVD release of Watch on the Rhine could not come at a better moment. It restores to us a major Lillian Hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett Hellman scholar Bernard F. Dicks audio commentary affirms his authorship. It presents a subtle performance by Bette Davis, who took a subdued secondary role long after she would become the workhorse queen at the Warner Bros. lot. Equally significantly, it reminds us that World War II had a purpose.Sure, you say, like we needed that. We have heard Cary Grant sermonizing in Destination Tokyo 1943 about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We have watched jackboots stomp the living hills in The Sound of Music 1965. We have toured an England callously occupied by Germany in It Happened Here 1966. Yet, truth to tell, we still need the message spread.I have an 81yearold friend who curses Franklin Roosevelt regularly. He feels that FDR connived the U.S. into a foreign fight we did not need, and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin. He is encouraged in his demonizing of Allied leaders and the trivializing of War Two by Patrick Buchanan.The political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that Adolf Hitler would have posed no further menace to Poland, Europe, or the world if only the Third Reich had been handed the Free City of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan holds that if those selfish Poles had not confronted the Nazis, drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France, no war would have engulfed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.Some commenters on this site feel that Watch sags under the weight of stale propaganda. Maybe. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have gotten the films point Some people hurt and kill to grab other peoples land, goods, and liberty; such people dominated the Axis Powers and enough did not appear in their vocabulary.Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors. They give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines, for actively facing down torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman did not care for Lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical. Of course, as a Hungarian he had seen firsthand Bela Kuns bloody dictatorship of the proletariat replace an outmoded empire and then topple to Admiral Horthys rightwing tyranny.In a marvelous cameo role added to the play by Hammett, Henry Daniell sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would doubtless stand with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the Plot of July 20th against Hitler. In April 1940, however, he pragmatically abets the Nazi cause, although he insults Herr Blecher the Butcher and scorns the Rumanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to peddle information on an Underground leader.Teck, a pauper and possible cuckold, wishes cash and a visa to return to Europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empireshattering Great War and the greater worldwide economic Depression. He has no political convictions, no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris lends this burntout cases Old World cynicism an edge of desperate menace.Lucille Watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping mans hostess, a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her waybut who does not adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls. She and her pallid officebound son belong to the American version of von Rammes and de Brancovis privileged kind. However, this family has not seen ruin and never will. They are moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it.This mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward National Socialism and Fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit Buchanan.

A closer examination reveals only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high placings were enough to take it to near the halfway mark.The outbreak of the Second World War saw the movies production shifted around England and America, eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars. Like Citizen Kane, it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love.The special effects, outstanding for the time, are still reasonable, and actually hold up if you squint. But it is not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions. Among them is an amusing horse, constructed out of a kit model, which, when a key is inserted up it is rear end, begins to fly. There is also a killer toy of the sixarmed Goddess Kali, perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrificlooking giant spider. Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet. But most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn genie nearly a thousand feet tall! Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. And look out for the moment where he is tricked back into his bottle!John Justin does well as the Arabic king who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a stiff upper lip. Sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15\u0096yearold, is nearnamesake Abu, a likeably cocky thief. After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer Conrad Veidt, Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog. When it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind Ahmeds Justins perspective, we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues. In truth, the second half is someway the better, being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature.Three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient; I would not classify this as a musical. It is all great fun; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, Veidt is the boohiss villain, and Abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber. It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies, but once you have sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in.

quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.Budget costs happen in US films too, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there. But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon. He certainly was not going to get scenery like that in the UK. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best artset direction for a color film, and best special effects. Only Miklos Roszas original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it is impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez. This was Veidts career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star. Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features. Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant. Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today. It is an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.","index":440,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film.

She is a much underrated actress and I have to admit I have had a crush on her since I first saw her probably in Wuthering Heights 40 or more years ago. The real star in this movie, however, is Paul Lukas, and he deserved all the accolades he got. He makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Naziism had to be stopped, and anything that helped do it was good. He gave his children a line about being bad, and that they should not be bad, but as he said earlier when conversing with adults, he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation. Lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do.Some people think his victim was a Nazi, but I do not think so  I think he was only after the money. His Nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him.One interesting point in the film, and presumably also in the play, is the fact that Muller Lucas is a German. While the anti German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in WWII, there was considerable antiGerman sentiment and some Germans were interred similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestry. It was something of an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the NaziSoviet pact!. After all, the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians. I think, however, that the Dresden bombing and firestorm happened later, after Watch on the Rhine was released.The title is something of a play on words, as the watch is looking west, from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song  used in WWII, but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well. But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own Wach am Rhein.All the other actors did an excellent job here; although Bodo was too much there are children like him. I am surprised he did not give his fathers secret away.

I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabus battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros, Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. Georges Perinals photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including A Matter of Life and Death aka Stairway to Heaven and The Red Shoes. He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles.As with all great works of art, the beauty of The Thief of Bagdad lies in the detail. Every frame has its own magical charm. The story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving.

","I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabus battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. ","Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros, Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. ","Georges Perinals photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. ","One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including A Matter of Life and Death aka Stairway to Heaven and The Red Shoes. ","He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles.As with all great works of art, the beauty of The Thief of Bagdad lies in the detail. ","Every frame has its own magical charm. ","The story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving. ","Here is a film that will never grow old."]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <ADVP <RB first>> <VP <VBD saw> <NP <NN Thief>> <PP <IN as> <NP <NP <DT a> <NN child>> <SBAR <WHNP <WDT which>> <S <VP <VBZ makes> <NP <PRP me>> <ADVP <RB almost> <PP <IN as> <ADJP <JJ old>>>> <PP <IN as> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN Jinn>> <SBAR <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBP guess>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <IN As> <S <NP <DT any> <NN kid>> <VP <MD would> <VP <VB be>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBD was> <ADJP <JJ delighted> <PP <IN with> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN imagination> <, ,> <NN inventiveness> <CC and> <NN energy>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT the> <NN film>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <ADVP <NP <JJ Several> <NNS years>> <RB later>> <, ,> <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBD realized> <SBAR <WHADJP <WRB how> <JJ much> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN satire> <CC and> <NN wit>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT the> <NN script>>>>>> <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBD had> <VP <VBN missed> <PP <IN on> <NP <DT that> <JJ first> <NN viewing>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP I>> <VP <VBP have> <ADVP <RB never>> <VP <VBN passed> <PRT <RP up>> <NP <DT an> <NN opportunity>> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB watch> <NP <PRP it>> <PP <IN throughout> <NP <DT the> <VBG intervening> <NNS years>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <PP <IN In> <NP <NP <NN addition>> <PP <TO to> <NP <DT the> <NN script>>>>> <, ,> <NP <DT the> <NN production>> <VP <VBZ transcends> <NP <DT the> <NN fantasy> <NN genre>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <DT This>> <VP <VBZ is> <NP <NP <NNP Korda>> <, ,> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN storyteller>> <PP <IN at> <NP <PRP$ his> <RB very>>>>> <ADVP <RB best>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <WHADVP <WRB When>> <S <NP <PRP you>> <VP <VBP see> <NP <NN Thief>> <PP <IN as> <NP <DT a> <NN child>>>>>> <NP <PRP you>> <VP <VBP know> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <NN youve>> <VP <VBD had> <NP <DT a> <JJ great> <NN time>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <WHADVP <WRB When>> <S <NP <PRP you>> <VP <VBP see> <NP <NN Thief>> <PP <IN as> <NP <DT an> <JJ adult>>>>>> <NP <PRP you>> <VP <VBP know> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <NN youve>> <VP <VBN seen> <NP <DT a> <NN masterpiece>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <PRP$ Its>> <PP <IN as> <ADJP <JJ timeless> <PP <IN as> <NP <DT the> <NN story>>>>> <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ treats>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <FRAG <NP <DT An> <JJ amazing> <NNP work.Thomas> <NNP McCarthy>>>>"],"txt":"I first saw Thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the Jinn I guess.

Alexander Kordas London Films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Replete with swords  sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It also is a fine piece of film making, featuring good acting and an intelligent script.Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boyish Thief, Sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed  action.The rest of the cast do fine work. John Justin is both energetic  sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action when he is not transformed into a dog but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the film, massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys Malleson was also responsible for the films screen play  dialogue. Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of Jaffars accomplice and the sixarmed Silver Dancer.The film was begun in Britain, but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites  pinks.Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysores stables when he was discovered by Kordas company and set before the cameras. His first four films ELEPHANT BOY1937, THE DRUM1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD1940, JUNGLE BOOK1942 were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS 1947 being the one great exception. His final movie, Walt Disneys A TIGER WALKS 1964 was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.","index":451,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer.As Europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames, Sir Alexander Kordas London Films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights.

strands woven together. The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas. He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffars deeds and hate him. He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief. The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra. There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by. Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. Then he is captured. When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog. Jaffar then asks for the Princesss hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra. The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog. The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. He does awaken her. She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard. She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmads sight and turn Abu back into a thief. The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island. Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. For freeing him, he gets three wishes. His first is for sausages. In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death. Abu makes a second wish, to find Ahmad. The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the AllSeeing eye. Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddesss statue. Abu gazes into the eye and sees Ahmad in a canyon. He has the genie take him to Ahmad. Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. She smells a flower and forgets everything at once. Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad. Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the eye. Abu finds himself in the Land of Legend, where the old men who rule want to make him their king. He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess. The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution. Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him. Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be. This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda. The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography. The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating. The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong, Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes. The production, apart from its gorgeous and expensivelooking visual splendors, I claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar. Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima, and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan. As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role. This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also. Its imaginative content stands in contrast to verystrong realistic sets, costumes and setdesign elements. This is one of the most memorable idealevel fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.","index":452,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["The storyline of The Thief of Bagdad is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together.

prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her. Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog. This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa, restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that is really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs. It does not have any cheesy moments and the love story is not a waste of time. The production designs are just stunning in this movie. From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. Even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in todays cinema. The music and songs are also well done. Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies. I am usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I will be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you do not see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill. Way before todays modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place. One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that is what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie. They are just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they are all just fantasy beings.It is literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration. The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet. It is not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it is nice to know that I am not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie. I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it is amazing. That is a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time. Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40s so give it a break. Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under todays standard.If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this will not be their cup of tea.","index":454,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her.

After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu, Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love \u0096 along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for Sabu! and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything. The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940, but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action \u0096 but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later. Anyway, if I am requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects! Favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Halls suitably romantic song; the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend \u0096 in fact, the stunning colours throughout; Sabu and Rozsas triumphant but still wistful finale.

Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the films color in the way it had originally been presented in. True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it  nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the MGM DVD 3 Dec 2002 issue. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!! It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once, I watched it a second time. The only Extras are a Spanish Dubbed version, SubTitles in both English  Spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer. Thank you MGM for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now, one can only hope that Kordas FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Kordas JUNGLE BOOK to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on DVD.","index":460,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I first discovered Alexander Kordas 1940 Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950s on a reissue billed as The Wonder Show of the Century!

1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of Thief of Bagdad, to less imposing, more recent attempts. The best, however, remains 1940s version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. Those effects still work their charm.No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt. Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornadolike black swirl Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. Justins Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he is very good. For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there is a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. Still, I do not think anyone under eight ought to see Thief of Bagdad.This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. It was great to see computerbesotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.Thief of Bagdad is a prewar Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases.

to Nazi Germany by that infamous nonaggression pact signed in August of 1939. So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line did not change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lukass nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukass wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It is the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They are made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Daviss from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukass antifascist background. His suspicions are quite correct, it is the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they have become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellmans significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count. He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other antifascist classic, Casablanca. Though it is an item firmly planted in those specific times, Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern antifascist message that bears repeating infinitely.","index":466,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous nonaggression pact signed in August of 1939.

Donath. This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, worldrenowned tenor whose name is known even today.The film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film. If you are a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd  even if Caruso as wife Dorothy just had a baby girl. Also it is highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him.In taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso as life. What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in Girl of the Golden West, There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. The reason for that photo? His only shirt was in the laundry. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor TalkingMachine Company later RCA Victor. He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake.Instead, the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha, which never happened. He had a hemorrhage during LElisir damore at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino  peritonitis. His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto. So when it says on the screen suggested by Dorothy Caruso as biography of her husband, that is what it was  suggested. What is true is that Dorothys father disowned her after her marriage, and left her 1 of his massive estate. They also did have a daughter Gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 1072007. However, Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy.Some people say that Lanzas voice is remarkably like Caruso as, but just listen to Caruso sing in the film Match Point  Caruso as voice is remarkably unlike Lanzas. In fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, Caruso could have sung as a baritone. He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not. Lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another. He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music. He sings the music in The Great Caruso with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career. His acting is natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself.Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans, which are probably one and the same.","index":469,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Mario Lanza, of course, is The Great Caruso in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath.

make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso. But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until MetroGoldwynMayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.And why should it. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth. To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film. His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought. He is shown in a recording studio once late in his life. Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live. But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men. It is why both became the legends that they are.What the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a Caruso to stick to opera. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we could not get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna also.Though Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso.If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this as not it. If you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, than you should not miss The Great Caruso.","index":471,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso.

","The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso. ","Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we could not get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna also.Though Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso.If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this as not it. ","If you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, than you should not miss The Great Caruso."]},{"parsed_sentence":["<ROOT <S <NP <DT THE> <JJ GREAT> <NN CARUSO>> <VP <VP <VBD was> <NP <NP <DT the> <JJS biggest> <NN hit>> <PP <IN in> <NP <DT the> <NN world>>>> <PP <IN in> <NP <CD 1951>>>> <CC and> <VP <VBD broke> <NP <DT all> <NN box> <NN office> <NNS records>> <PP <IN at> <NP <NP <NNP Radio> <NNP City> <NNP Music> <NNP Hall>> <PP <IN in> <NP <DT a> <NN year>>>>> <SBAR <WHADVP <WRB when>> <S <NP <RBS most> <NNS movergoers>> <VP <VBD were> <NP <NP <NNS stayathomes>> <VP <VBG watching> <NP <PRP$ their> <JJ new> <CD 7> <NNP Motorola> <NNS televisions>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <RB Almost> <DT all> <JJ recent> <NN box> <NN office> <NNS figures>> <VP <VBP are> <ADJP <JJ false> <SBAR <IN because> <S <NP <PRP they>> <VP <VBP fail> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB adjust> <NP <NN inflation>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <ADVP <RB Obviously>> <NP <NP <NNS todays>> <NP <CD 10> <NNS movies>>> <VP <MD will> <VP <VB dominate>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <PP <IN In> <NP <CD 1951>>> <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBD cost> <NP <QP <CD 90c> <TO to> <CD 1.60>>> <PP <IN at> <NP <NNP Radio> <NNP City>>> <: ;> <NP <NP <NP <CD 44c>> <PP <TO to> <NP <NP <CD 75c> <JJ first> <NN run>> <PP <IN at> <NP <NP <NNP Loews> <NNP Palace>> <PP <IN in> <NP <NNP Washington> <NNP DC>>>>>>>> <, ,> <CC or> <NP <NP <CD 35c> <TO to> <CD 50c>> <PP <IN in> <NP <NN neighborhood> <NNS runs>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <FRAG <SBAR <WHNP <WDT What>> <S <NP <NNS counts>> <VP <VBZ is> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN number>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <NP <NNS people>> <VP <VBG responding> <PP <TO to> <NP <DT the> <NN picture>>>>> <, ,> <RB not> <NP <NP <JJ unadjusted> <NN box> <NN office> <NNS media>> <NP <NN spin>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <NP <DT The> <NN genius>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT THE> <JJ GREAT> <NN CARUSO>>>> <VP <VBD was> <SBAR <IN that> <S <NP <DT the> <NNS filmmakers>> <VP <VP <VBD took> <NP <NP <JJS most>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <DT the> <JJ actual> <NN life>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NNP Enrico> <NNP Caruso>>>>>> <PP <ADVP <RB really>> <RB not> <NP <DT a> <JJ great> <NN story>>> <ADVP <RB anyway>>> <CC and> <VP <VBD threw> <NP <PRP it>> <PP <IN in> <NP <DT the> <NN trash>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <ADVP <RB Instead>> <, ,> <NP <NP <CD 90>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT the> <NNS movies> <NN focus>>>> <VP <VBD was> <PP <IN on> <NP <DT the> <NN music>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <ADVP <RB Thus>> <NP <NNP MGM>> <VP <VBD gave> <NP <PRP us>> <NP <NP <NP <DT the> <JJS best> <NN living>> <NP <NN opera> <NN singer> <NNP MARIO> <NNP LANZA>>> <VP <VBG doing> <NP <NP <DT the> <NN music>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <DT the> <JJS bestever> <JJ historic> <NN opera> <NN singer>> <NP <NNP ENRICO> <NNP CARUSO>>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <DT The> <NN result>> <VP <VBD was> <NP <DT a> <JJ wonderful> <NN movie>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <ADJP <RB Too> <JJ bad>> <NN LANZA>> <VP <MD would> <VP <VB throw> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN life> <CC and> <NN career>> <ADVP <RB away>> <PP <IN on> <NP <NN overeating>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <NP <ADJP <ADJP <RB Too> <JJ fat> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB play> <NP <DT THE> <JJ STUDENT> <NNP PRINCE>> <, ,> <SBAR <S <NP <NNP Edmund> <NNP Purdom>> <VP <VBD took> <NP <PRP$ his> <NN place>> <PP <IN with> <NP <NP <NNP Lanzas> <NN voice>> <VP <VBN dubbed> <PP <PP <IN in>> <, ,> <CC and> <PP <IN with> <NP <DT the> <RB formerly> <JJ handsome>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <CC and> <ADJP <JJ notfat>>> <NNP Lanza>> <VP <VBD pictured> <PP <IN in> <NP <DT the> <NN advertising>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <SBAR <IN If> <S <NP <PRP you>> <VP <VBP want> <S <VP <TO to> <VP <VB see> <NP <DT THE> <JJ GREAT> <NN CARUSO>>>>>>>> <, ,> <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ is> <ADVP <RB almost> <RB always>> <PP <IN on> <NP <NP <NNP eBay>> <PP <IN for> <NP <QP <CD 2.00> <CC or> <JJR less>>>>>>> <. .>>>","<ROOT <S <VP <VB Do> <RB not> <VP <VB be> <VP <VBN put> <PRT <RP off>> <PP <IN by> <NP <DT the> <JJ low> <NN price>>> <, ,> <SBAR <IN as> <S <NP <PRP it>> <VP <VBZ reflects> <NP <NP <RB only> <DT the> <JJ easy> <NN availability>> <PP <IN of> <NP <NP <NNS copies>> <, ,> <NP <NP <RB not> <DT the> <NN quality>> <PP <IN of> <NP <DT the> <NN movie>>>>>>>>>>>>> <. .>>>"],"txt":"THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most movergoers were stayathomes watching their new 7 Motorola televisions.

Paul Lukas whom I believe is repeating his stage role here, Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods. An antiFascist, a worker in the underground movement, many times injured, and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller Lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy motherinlaw. But he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests Coulouris is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out.Great performances abound in this film, written very much to put forth Lillian Hellmans liberal point of view. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released, as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe American homes. The movies big controversy today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar over Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt. The monologue he has about the need to kill is gutwrenching, just to mention one scene.Though this is not what one thinks of as a Bette Davis movie, she gives a masterful performance here as Kurts loyal and loving wife, Sara. Her acting tugs at the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender.The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions. Lillian Hellman is not everyones cup of tea, but unlike The Little Foxes, she has written some truly sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story given A casting and production values by Warner Brothers.

Having saw it twice, I could not help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me  who does not believe in Nora Ephron  Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But, I did not rate it as a great film, it still seemed to me like another thinking persons feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that is more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities did not strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I have seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaterss own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. I do not know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celines first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I have seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I do not know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. I am sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.","index":478,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago.

The primary reason to see Before Sunrise, is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As Celine, this sexy, brainy, soulful browneyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their midtwenties. Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as Jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a twoweek train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oftcynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. Given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when Jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a halfbaked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. For whatever reason, she probably will not show, while Jesse, who ends up working at Target or if he is lucky the local library, will go back to Vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone.Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, Before Sunrise is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel, Before Sunset.","index":486,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love.

I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended. I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. People I talked to said there was too much talking! Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters. I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American moviegoing public seems to have a tendency to want easytofollow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused. They also like to be spoonfed tidy endingshappy OR sad. This disgusts me. Nobody wants to be challenged anymore??? And as for the ending and I do not want to be a spoiler, I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again. It is all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny. It is a very personal film that does not speak to all people. But it certainly spoke to me. Give it a chance! Be patient with it! Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna. Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters. As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass. It is very intimate. Plus, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life. They must have improvised during some parts and it works well. They have a great chemistry in their roles. Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses. I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr. Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made. It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much. Bravo for romance!!!","index":487,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["When I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening, I was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it.

of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, persay, so much as it is about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does, at least that is deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather. Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the town, in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it is like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it is often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what were not really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you will love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul I loved the bit about the quakers in the church, and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what is fascinating about the film is that it is never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile, it is always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they are not incessantly annoying in that 90s GenerationX mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which is not a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret, Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, hoho, or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet, where it is very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it firsthand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however selfcontained, as it may lead into something more. Who is to say you cannot suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklaters thesis, but there is more to it than just that. It is a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking on the phone in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the others friend.

","I did not know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. ","They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate.

film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca. Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of The Mortal Storm and Watch On The Rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with Casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose Paul Lukas instead for the Best Actor Oscar. It does not strike me as totally wrong. Lukas had a good career in film both here and in England  he is the villain in The Lady Vanishes, and this performance was his best one. Bogart had more great performances in him than Rick Blaine for instance, he was ignored for Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Roy Earle in High Sierra two years earlier, both of which were first rate performances, and he would not get an Oscar for his greatest performances as Fred C. Dobbs in The Treasure Of Sierra Madres, the writermurder suspect in In A Lonely Place, and Captain Philip Francis Queeg in The Caine Mutiny afterward  he got it for Charley in The African Queen. I think that Bogie should have got it for the role of Dobbs, but it did not happen. But Lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career. Few can claim that.To me the film to look at with Watch On The Rhine is based on another playscript by Hellman, The Searching Wind. They both look at Americas spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s. The Searching Wind is really looking at the whole interwar period, while Watch On The Rhine, set in the years just proceeding our entry into World War II, deals with a few weeks of time. Therefore it is better constructed as a play, and more meaningful for it is impact. The film has many good performances, led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined antiNazi fightercourier, Davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to Lukas being the center of the plays activities, Coulouris as the selfish, conniving, but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck, Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife, and Kurt Katch, who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassys Gestapo chief about Coulouris and others who would deal with the Nazis. It has dialog with bite in it. And what it says is quite true. It also has moments of near poetry. Witness the scene, towards the end, when Coulouris is left alone with Lukas and Davis, and says, The New World has left the scene to the Old World. Hellman could write very well at times.Given the strength of the film script and performances I would rate this film highly among World War II films.","index":499,"label":1,"splited_sentence":["Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca.
